                <p>Bioengineering researchers are working to lighten the burdens of hearing
                    loss &ndash; literally &ndash; with a new generation of hearing devices that use light
                    instead of electricity to trigger an auditory response. Proponents of the technology
                    believe light-based approaches could be a major step forward in hearing prosthetics,

                    ambient sounds can help many people, but they don&rsquo;t work for everyone. With some
                    500,000 users around the world, cochlear implants have taken hearing instruments to a
                    new level. They work by transforming sounds into electronic signals, separating them by
                    frequency, and transmitting them to a series of electrodes surgically placed within the
                    cochlea &ndash; a hollow, snail-shaped chamber within the inner ear. The electrodes
                    reproduce the sound experience by stimulating the auditory neurons in key sites within
                    the cochlea.</p>

                        title="30 Years of Bionic Ears">Cochlear implants</a> have been continually
                    improving since their commercial introduction in the mid-1970s, but performance
                    limitations persist. Appreciating music or discerning speech in a noisy environment, for
                    example, are still major challenges for implant users. Within the narrow, coiled anatomy
                    of the cochlea, electrical current spreads laterally from each electrode over a large
                    area, causing interference and diminishing frequency resolution. To the implant user,
                    sounds become muddled and difficult to differentiate. These issues with resolution,
                    along with the expense and physical discomfort of the implantation procedure, discourage
                    many potential users from trying cochlear implants.</p>

                <p>Optical stimulation may be the breakthrough to increase the frequency resolution of
                    cochlear implants and make them a more universal solution, says Tobias Moser, an
                    auditory neuroscience expert at the University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany. Moser
                    is a pioneer in one of the two primary approaches to optical cochlear implant
                    engineering. His method combines the gene reprogramming technique known as optogenetics
                    with a fiber-optic-based device that carries light pulses into the cochlea from a remote
                    light source. The other major approach, as originally developed by Northwestern
                    University otolaryngology professor Claus-Peter Richter, involves the use of
                    near-infrared laser beams to recreate the sound experience by manipulating fluid within
                    the cochlea. In proof-of-concept testing with various animal models of hearing loss,
                    both approaches have produced encouraging results that suggest the technology will one
                    day be viable for human hearing correction.</p>

                <h2>Optogenetic implants</h2>

                <p>Optogenetics has been explored in animals as a possible treatment for a range of human
                    neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, drug abuse,
                    chronic pain and schizophrenia. In an optogenetic experiment, a lab animal is injected
                    with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying a payload of genes to targeted sites in
                    the nervous system. These genes encode the production of proteins known as
                    channelrhodopsins which, when exposed to light, trigger a desired response in the host
                    nerve cells.</p>

                <p>Moser&rsquo;s group is one of the few adapting optogenetics to the correction of
                    deafness. In a recent headline-making paper in the journal <em>Science Translational
                        Medicine,</em> the group reported success with optogenetics to achieve spatially and
                    temporally precise, cell-specific stimulation of cochlear neurons in deaf gerbils. The
                    work builds on earlier studies with mice and rats that first proved the principle of
                    optical cochlear implants.<br />
                    <br />
                    The gerbil is a superior model for hearing research because the animal&rsquo;s cochlea
                    is somewhat closer in size to a human&rsquo;s and its hearing range extends to the low
                    frequency ranges perceived by the human ear. Through a battery of electrophysiological
                    and behavioral tests, the team measured stable optical auditory responses in the test
                    animals&rsquo; brains over a period of weeks. Although commercialization of the
                    technology faces a number of scientific hurdles and is at least two years away, Moser
                    has launched a start-up company, OptoGenTech, to further develop his ideas. A key next
                    step, he said, is to expand the current study from a single-channel device to a
                    multichannel system based on waveguide arrays or LEDs to help determine the optimal
                    number of stimulation channels future optical cochlear implants should possess.</p>

                <h2>Laser Listening</h2>
                <p>Other groups are fine-tuning optical cochlear implants that don&rsquo;t require the
                    reprogramming of genes. Claus-Peter Richter, an otolaryngology professor and principal
                    investigator at Northwestern University&rsquo;s Auditory Research Laboratory, pioneered
                    an approach using pulsed near-infrared lasers and fiber-optic implants to achieve
                    infrared neural stimulation (INS). In this approach, auditory neurons are stimulated in
                    their native state as the laser pulses rapidly increase the temperature of the fluid
                    within the cochlea, causing a portion of it to expand. That expansion generates a sound
                    wave, which stimulates the hairlike sensory receptors in the inner ear, which then
                    transmit signals via the auditory nerve to the brain.</p>
                <p>Building on those ideas, a team of bioengineers at the Centre Suisse d&rsquo;Electronique
                    et de Microtechnique (CSEM, Neuchatel, Switzerland) are developing a fully implantable
                    single-channel optoacoustic device powered by a rechargeable vertical cavity
                    surface-emitting laser (VCSEL). &nbsp;Positioning the laser source directly within the
                    cochlea delivers higher-intensity stimulation, which increases the likelihood of
                    producing audible sound. The group, led by physicist Mark Fretz, sealed the tiny laser
                    in an optically transparent, biocompatible sapphire box coated with an antifouling agent
                    to prevent loss of signal due to tissue adherence. The team is currently working to
                    further miniaturize the apparatus and reduce power consumption to lengthen operation
                    time between battery charges.</p>
