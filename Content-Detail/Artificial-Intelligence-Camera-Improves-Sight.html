                        <p>The cameras used in today&rsquo;s autonomous vehicles are combined with computers to
                            recognize objects and make smart driving decisions. But more strain is being placed on
                            those computers, which lag behind the advances in camera vision, increased image

                            The opto-electrical system in the AI camera establishes a two-layer neural network that
                            cuts down on the extra hoops required by conventional computers to pre-process, sort,
                            and classify images.</p>

                        <p>Optical technology was used back in CD-ROMs to record data and is used today in
                            telecommunications networks for high-speed data transfers. Stanford&rsquo;s AI camera
                            does more with optics by using photons for computation, much like how electrons drive
                            conventional computing. Optical computing has shown promise as a faster form of
                            computing but hasn&rsquo;t fully developed yet.</p>
                        <p>The AI camera has a customized optical transistor that in real time analyzes optical data
                            from the camera -- light rays in this case &ndash; and filters the images based on
                            patterns. The optical computing is done through a combination of algorithms and pixel
                            association to classify and label pixels.</p>
                        <p>The AI camera identifies basic objects like signs, animals, cars and planes much faster
                            and with less power than conventional computers, Chang said. Conventional computers
                            would require cameras to transfer all image data to power hungry processing units like
                            GPUs, which have to parse through every pixel to identify objects.</p>
                        <p>Fewer processing cycles and light-speed preprocessing power makes the AI camera extremely
                            effective, Chang said.</p>
                        <p>But the camera&rsquo;s optical computer is still limited in scope and doesn&#39;t have
                            the computing power to help the camera &ldquo;learn.&rdquo; Its pattern-based processing
                            capabilities are also limited.</p>
                        <p>The AI camera requires a conventional computer to do the heavy lifting, like learning or
                            providing context to a full scene that may have multiple objects. Conventional computers
                            are also needed to create rich visual data sets for drones, autonomous cars and robots.
                            It works with popular deep learning platforms like Google&rsquo;s Tensor and
                            Facebook&rsquo;s Caffe.</p>
                        <p>The AI camera can be classified as an effective &ldquo;edge&rdquo; device, which is
                            becoming important in IoT. Edge devices like the AI camera cut out irrelevant data and
                            help identify objects quicker, reducing the overall computing stress. Smart meters and
                            other sensor devices are similarly gaining such decision-making capabilities that reduce
                            the strain on central computers doing high-level analytics.</p>
                        <p>One major challenge the researchers faced was for the AI camera to identify images in
                            dark conditions. The team overcame that with the neural network design and adjusted
                            mathematical models, Chang said.</p>
                        <p>Still in its early development stages, the camera is far from commercialization. But the
                            researchers believe they have created a better solution for such a critical application.
