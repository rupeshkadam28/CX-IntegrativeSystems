                            <p class="mt-lg-0">It was going to be a gleaming ghost town, shimmering amid an arid expanse of
                                southeastern New Mexico. Energy and infrastructure consultant Marble Arch Partners
                                proposed building The Center for Innovation, Testing and Evaluation to do full-scale
                                testing of the smart cities systems and technologies that will define the future of
                                urban development.</p>
                            <p >The ambitious plan called for spending $1 billion to build an uninhabited
                                city large enough for 35,000 people, fitted with intelligent building, transportation,
                                and energy systems. Without human drivers on the road or children playing in the
                                streets, engineers could test new systems without worrying about disrupting everyday
                                life. Drones could hover over autonomously operated vehicles while streetlights watched
                                buses to see if they were running on time.</p>

                            <p >Five years after the announcement, ground still has not been broken and the
                                window may be closing. Instead of running tests in the middle of nowhere, cities are
                                installing smart systems at an increasing pace, beginning with pilot projects and
                                expanding them as the results prove out. Using their own infrastructure as a test bed,
                                their results promise to change how cities manage utilities and services while providing
                                citizens with tools to exploit the information they generate.</p>
                            <p >According to a report by Navigant Research, smart cities are a global
                                phenomenon. There are 250 projects underway in 178 cities worldwide, with Europe leading
                                the way because of its aggressive climate change policies. The research firm estimates
                                the global market for smart city technologies and services to be worth $40.1 billion in
                                2017, with growth expected to reach a whopping $97.9 billion by 2026. Barriers to entry
                                are falling as sensors improve and <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/disrupting-the-grid">smart
                                    technologies</a> grow more efficient, more capable, more interoperable, and less
                                expensive.</p>

                            <p >In a smart city, wireless motion and flow sensors, low-cost video cameras,
                                temperature and noise monitors, and air quality devices feed data continuously into
                                systems, which use them to control traffic lights, streetlights, pedestrian displays,
                                power distribution and more. Cities use them to monitor traffic, mass transit,
                                pedestrian flows, and crime. All these devices link with rugged wide area networks that
                                send data to the cloud, where powerful analytic engines the data to make cities
                                efficient and safer.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;There are so many different technologies, but lighting is one of the
                                big growth areas,&rdquo; said Ryan Citron, a Navigant analyst who co-authored the
                                report. &ldquo;LED lighting is becoming the go-to replacement technology.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >There are two key reasons why LEDs have become the foundational technology
                                of smart city networks, Citron said. First, they offer energy savings of up to 80
                                percent and a fast payback period. Second, each light carries a microprocessor, making
                                it a potential node in a system that is ideal for setting up a wireless wide area
                                network. These networks create a scaffold that supports the buildout of future smart
                                system capabilities.</p>

                            <h3>Leveraging Data</h3>

                            <p >San Diego officials are spending $30 million to make their city smarter. The
                                effort, the most ambitious in the world, involves replacing 14,000 streetlights with LED
                                lights and 3,200 sensors. Those sensors will gather information on everything from
                                vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement to changes in air quality. The data will
                                enable the city to reroute emergency vehicles around congestion, smooth the flow of the
                                daily commute, and point drivers to vacant parking spaces as they come available.</p>

                            <p >Just as important, San Diego&rsquo;s emerging open-source platform will put
                                raw, anonymous data in the hands of entrepreneurs searching for new opportunities and
                                citizens looking for ways to make city life better, said David Graham, the city&rsquo;s
                                deputy chief operating officer.</p>

                            <p >San Diego has both an educated population and a strong tech startup
                                community, and Graham is actively courting two-way interaction with them by sponsoring
                                hackathons using city data. A favorite that has emerged from those sessions will tell
                                food trucks where people are congregating and where they can park.</p>

                            <p >Entrepreneurs could also use the data for more traditional market research,
                                analyzing pedestrian traffic to decide where to locate a new retail store or how much
                                rent to charge for commercial property.&nbsp; The system was developed by GE, which now
                                is deploying it through a spin-off, Current. It retrofits existing lighting
                                infrastructure by installing energy-efficient LED lights that are fitted with sensors,
                                controls, wireless transmitters, and microprocessors.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;By repurposing light poles, you can transform to a digital
                                infrastructure,&rdquo; said Austin Ashe, general manager of Current&rsquo;s intelligent
                                cities program. &ldquo;This becomes a digital engine that extracts metadata from the
                                environment.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Of course, smart hardware needs equally smart software. GE believes that it
                                has a proven system in its Predix software platform, which is already used by industry
                                to generate operating <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/manufacturing-processing/putting-big-data-to-work">data</a>
                                from factory machines and devices.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p >In cities, the networked system extracts &ldquo;very granular&rdquo; data in
                                real time, and retains historical data it can use to predict trends in the movement of
                                people, traffic, or whatever topic city officials identify.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;It also creates an opportunity to leverage the data with the broader
                                software development community,&rdquo; Ashe said. &ldquo;It allows the broader community
                                to take the data and transform it into an appropriate application.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >In fact, smart city applications generate more data than most cities can
                                use. The volume of data is intimidating, said Ken Thompson, global technology leader for
                                smart cities and sensors for engineering giant CH2M. &ldquo;It scares a lot of people to
                                death about how to process all of that data,&rdquo; Thompson said.</p>

                            <p >As a result, many industries and cities today use only a small fraction of
                                the data available to them, he said. In one internal survey, Thompson found that water
                                clients process only about 10&nbsp;percent of their data. That is not efficient, though
                                it is driving the development of faster analytics engines that can process large volumes
                                of data more quickly.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;That data crunching ability is important,&rdquo; Thompson said,
                                &ldquo;but when you&rsquo;re developing the technology, you must have a subject matter
                                expert involved.&rdquo; While IT professionals can develop all sorts of algorithms, it
                                takes a subject matter expert&mdash;someone who understands city traffic or water
                                distribution&mdash;to make sure they are capturing the information needed to make
                                intelligent decisions.</p>

                            <h3>Data-Driven Decisions</h3>

                            <p >GE first approached San Diego when city officials were dealing with the
                                result of years of underinvestment in infrastructure.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Looking forward, rather than replace what we had with something that
                                was just a little better, it became a conversation about building an intelligent
                                platform,&rdquo; Graham said. The two parties decided to build a pilot network using 40
                                streetlights in San Diego&rsquo;s East Village neighborhood.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;After putting the sensors in the lights, we developed enough
                                information for a parking application,&rdquo; Graham said. The city found there was a
                                value proposition with parking, and that it could use sensors to identify abandoned
                                vehicles and other roadway threats.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p >Just by themselves, the upgrade to LED lights made a lot of sense, Graham
                                said. &ldquo;With 2,000 lights, we found we could save a quarter-million dollars and cut
                                energy use up to 60 percent.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Overall, the city expects a 13-year payback period for the entire project.
                            </p>

                            <p >Yet the networked smart lights gave San Diego a new way to provide better
                                and more site-specific neighborhoods services. For example, it could dim lighting around
                                the nearby Palomar Observatory and in areas where people need &ldquo;dark sky,&rdquo;
                                Graham said. At the same time, the city could intensify the lighting elsewhere,
                                depending on pedestrian and vehicular traffic data provided by their sensor.</p>

                            <p >Like GE, Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services provides real-time data and
                                predictive models. It claims that its Intelligent Urban Exchange platform&rsquo;s
                                machine learning technology cuts the payback period for LED lighting almost in half. It
                                uses <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/media/manufacturing-design/video-why-big-data-matters-for-manufacturing">machine
                                    learning</a> to build models that customize the operation of individual streetlights
                                based on such historic data as crime patterns and pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The
                                platform will suggest optimal streetlight brightness and the most cost-effective
                                schedule to save energy.</p>

                            <p >Tata is using the same platform to optimize public transportation in
                                Belfort, a city of 50,000 in eastern France. Belfort operates 100 buses along five bus
                                routes. Tata&rsquo;s system gathers data such as the number of bus tickets sold and bus
                                speed and location. It is using the data to help Belfort optimize bus schedules to
                                reduce crowding, determine the savings from new road construction projects, and discover
                                ways to reduce costs.</p>

                            <p >Senthil Gunasekara, who heads corporate development and strategy for
                                Tata&rsquo;s Digital Software &amp; Solutions Group, said his company developed the
                                lighting and transportation applications as part of a staged rollout of smart city
                                applications on a common software platform.</p>

                            <p >Adding new application modules enables cities to phase in the expansion of
                                their smart city capabilities within a single platform. The software acts like a lingua
                                franca, enabling it to access, exchange, and analyze different types of urban data, from
                                streetlights and transportation to water and electrical systems.</p>

                            <p >That is a critical capability because most cities already collect a
                                voluminous amount of information. Much of it comes from sensors and reporting systems
                                that have been in place for years. These range from weather stations and traffic loggers
                                to footfall data and crime videos. The software can integrate this data to help city
                                managers make better day-to-day decisions, and to help them manage emergency response
                                during a crisis.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;It can take data from any source, analyze it, and present
                                solutions,&rdquo; Gunasekara said. &ldquo;The platform is quite open.&rdquo;</p>

                            <h3>Securing the Network</h3>

                            <p >Although cities want an open platform, they also want a secure platform to
                                keep hackers from tampering with urban infrastructure, Ashe said. After all, in a system
                                designed to respond automatically to sensor data, every LED light is also a portal into
                                the city&rsquo;s digital control processes.</p>

                            <p >Most systems use proven methods to discourage tampering. Predix, for
                                example, monitors individual devices and applications for signs of intrusion. It
                                encrypts communications between devices, networks, and the Cloud. The system allows only
                                authorized users to log in and will shut down any user who tries to do something if he
                                or she lacks permission.</p>

                            <p >New security standards are emerging to bring better security to every device
                                on the smart network. The recently released ISO/IEC 18598, for example, governs the
                                security of the physical elements of automated infrastructure management systems. AIM
                                components include computers, computer rooms, sensors, devices, cables, and all other
                                hardware.</p>

                            <p >The standard sets out a list of defined features AIM systems must have, said
                                Hans-Jurgen Neithammer, who led the ISO/IEC 18598 project. He is an expert on data
                                center architectures with CommScope, a New York-based firm that builds and manages
                                communication networks.</p>

                            <p >Under the new standard, AIM systems must know the location of all devices
                                and cabling, and be able to identify and block viruses or intrusions at the level of
                                those components. It must also monitor cable ports for &ldquo;unauthorized
                                changes,&rdquo; even something as mundane as the accidental disconnection of a cable.
                                &ldquo;When a critical circuit or element is removed, the system sends an alarm to a
                                manager,&rdquo; Neithammer said.</p>

                            <p >The new standard also mandates secure but interoperable interfaces for
                                software from different vendors. &ldquo;The software interface is now defined, so no
                                longer does a user have to rely on one vendor,&rdquo; Neithammer said.</p>

                            <p >This plug-and-play capability will allow cities to integrate new devices and
                                technologies into existing infrastructure without having to worry about the
                                compatibility of proprietary systems or equipment. &ldquo;That is the biggest advantage
                                from the user side,&rdquo; Neithammer said.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Interoperability is really important,&rdquo; agreed San Diego&rsquo;s
                                Graham. It gives the city more flexibility in how it deploys future systems, and it also
                                reduces cost, since it opens the door to greater competition.</p>

                            <p >Yet smart cities will require significant investments that go well beyond
                                the initial build. With digital infrastructure evolving so quickly, municipal officials
                                will probably need to update software frequently to improve capabilities.</p>

                            <p >Cities will also need new types of professionals to manage and interpret the
                                data. San Diego, for example, has hired a chief data officer to coordinate the
                                integration of its smart infrastructure with various city departments, and a data
                                scientist to monitor artificial intelligence and other technologies that it may one day
                                want to incorporate it into its system.</p>

                            <p >Cities will also have to rethink what they know about utility service
                                lifecycles. When a city builds a road or a bridge, it confidently expects it to last for
                                50 years or more. That is not the case with digital infrastructure.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Everyone needs to understand the lifecycle,&rdquo; Thompson said.
                                &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a three-to-five year lifecycle for communications systems.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p >All of this requires significant investments, yet more and more cities seem
                                willing to take the plunge.</p>

                            <p >In many ways, they have no other choice. The buildout of a private digital
                                infrastructure points the way toward even greater connectivity, and it is happening
                                rapidly whether cities are leading the way or not.</p>

                            <p >&ldquo;Everything is moving toward everything within cities being
                                connected,&rdquo; Ashe said. &ldquo;In ten years or sooner, <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/empty-town-for-autonomous-cars">autonomous
                                    cars</a> will be traveling on city streets and they need to know not only where they
                                are going, but what is coming at them and what is around the corner. Drones will be
                                flying overhead. People will have wearable devices constantly communicating.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p >Cities must learn to master those flows of traffic, energy, and information
                                to create a smarter city that makes life better for those who are connected and those
                                who are not. Either that, or they will descend into digital&mdash;and perhaps
                                physical&mdash;chaos as independent smart devices create their own ad hoc networks and
                                fight for their own piece of turf.</p>

                            <p >It is too soon to tell how this will all work out. Yet one thing is certain:
                                Smart city technology is moving so fast, it has no time to wait for a mock city in the
                                desert. It is happening now.</p>
