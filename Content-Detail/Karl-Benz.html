                <p>In the nascent days of the automobile industry, when the typical horseless carriage really
                    was an old buggy with an engine slapped on the back, the Benz Patent Motorwagen took things
                    to the next level. First driven in 1885 by German mechanical engineer Karl Benz (1844-1929),
                    this innovative vehicle was the first in the world designed and built stem to stern for
                    mechanized transportation via an internal combustion engine.</p>
                <p>Benz's auto boasted a tubular steel frame, electric coil ignition, rack and pinion steering,
                    an evaporative cooling system, and differential rear-end gears. Its 1600-cc., &frac34;
                    horsepower engine topped out at 8 mph.</p>
                <p>By virtue of his 1886 patent for the <a href="http://www.3wheelers.com/benz.html">Motorwagen</a>,
                    Benz has a solid claim to the
                    title of inventor of the first practical, commercially available, gasoline-powered
                    automobile. His string of innovations in key automotive components burnished his legend. And
                    despite a rocky start in business, the companies he formed set the industry standard for
                    quality and engineering across Europe and inspired U.S. upstarts like the Duryea brothers,
                    Ford, Studebaker, and Olds.</p>
                <p>Benz was raised chiefly by his mother in Karlsruhe, Germany. His father, a locomotive driver,
                    died in a train accident when Benz was two years old. The family was poor, but Benz's
                    education was a priority and he excelled as a student. He was admitted to the University of
                    Karlsruhe at age 15 and graduated in 1864 with his mechanical engineering degree.</p>
                <p>Bicycles were coming of age in the late 1860s, and Benz was an avid rider and mechanic. It
                    was while riding and tinkering that he first fantasized about a totally mechanized vehicle.

                </p>
                <p>Following a succession of unsatisfying jobs with engineering and construction firms around
                    Germany, Benz settled in Mannheim, where he partnered with August Ritter to open his first
                    iron foundry and sheet-metal workshop. The business began to flounder early, but soon Benz
                    would join forces with a new collaborator &ndash; his new wife, Bertha &ndash; who provided
                    vital capital and a vision for success on par with his own.</p>
                <p>Karl and Bertha set up housekeeping in 1872 and the first of their five children arrived a
                    year later. Karl focused their factory's attention on the development of new and better
                    engines, and he worked diligently to score new patents as a way to maximize their income.
                    His inventions included a throttle system, battery-powered ignition systems, spark plugs,
                    gear shifters, carburetors, the water radiator, and the clutch. By 1885, he was ready to put
                    it all together in a fully gas-powered car. The Benz Patent Motorwagen's innovative features
                    included a four-stroke engine, three wire-spoke wheels, and cozy two-passenger seating. The
                    one critical thing missing, however, was a customer base.</p>
                <p>Imagine a time when there was no such thing as a car commercial. When gasoline was a
                    household cleanser sold only at the drug store. When even the best long-distance roads were
                    rough, narrow tracks scratched out across the countryside. The public was far from sold on
                    the need for, or practicality of, motorized transportation. Benz's car would change all
                    that, but not without another critical boost from Bertha. Her natural-born marketing moxie
                    literally put the car on the road to success.</p>
                <p>It was Bertha who in 1888 illicitly appropriated a Motorwagen and drove 66 miles from
                    Mannheim to Pforzheim to visit her mother. It was the first long-distance trip ever
                    attempted in a horseless carriage. Her 8-mph exploits alarmed the citizenry, earning
                    priceless publicity. She informed her husband of her safe arrival by telegram, returning
                    home the next day.</p>
                <p>Along with the PR impact, Bertha's sensational journey identified several refinements to make
                    the car safer and more powerful, including brake linings and the idea of an extra gear for
                    climbing hills. Benz began selling cars that summer, and his model 3 Motorwagen was a star
                    of the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. Today Bertha's famous road trip is celebrated every two
                    years with an antique car rally along the same stretch of highway.</p>
                <p>Through a succession of companies launched during the early 1900s, Benz remained the leading
                    automobile producer in Europe for decades. Innovations in racing car design, automobile mass
                    production, and novel engine design continued under Benz's leadership during this period.
                </p>
                <p>By the early 1920s, Germany's crumbling economy and heated competition between Benz and the
                    Stuttgardt-based Daimler &ndash; the maker of the Mercedes engine &ndash; resulted in a
                    merger deal. The Daimler-Benz company was formed in 1926, and the Mercedes-Benz model naming
                    conventions that exist today were first introduced.</p>
                <p>Karl Benz died in April 1929, and Bertha followed in 1944. Their respective contributions to
                    the history of the automobile mirror the vital relationship between innovation and marketing
                    that continues to drive the industry today.</p>
