					Sept 2009; Designing a new machine or improving a process can take a fair amount of thought
					and consideration; once prototyped, it can still take years or even decades to be
					commercialized and have an impact on society. Sometimes, however, the entire process can be
					marvelously quick, easy, and world-changing.</p>
				<p>
					Take, for example, the cotton gin.</p>
				<p>
					Eli Whitney conceived this device almost on the spur of the moment. Yet, for all its fame
					and historic significance, one rarely sees an illustration of this legendary machine.
					Knowing as much as we do about its reputation and being conditioned to expect a revelation,
					when present-day engineers see the primitive hardware of the machine, it&rsquo;s usually a
					bit of a letdown. Although simple in design, the cotton gin solved a pressing economic
					problem and transformed both agricultural and industrial America. Only after comparing the
					economy of the American South before and after the introduction of the gin can we appreciate
					its historic impact.</p>

				<p><strong>Keeping Cotton Lucrative</strong></p>

				<p>
					Before the cotton gin, slavery had been on its way out&mdash;farmers realized it was more
					expensive to maintain slaves, compared to the value of what they could produce. Cotton was a
					troublesome crop anyway; its fiber could only be separated from the sticky, embedded seeds
					by hand, a grueling and exhausting process.</p>
				<p>
					This changed dramatically, of course, with the advent of the cotton gin. Suddenly cotton
					became a lucrative crop and a major export for the South. However, because of this increased
					demand, many more slaves were needed to grow cotton and harvest the fields. Slave ownership
					became a fiery national issue and eventually led to the Civil War.</p>
				<p>
					It was only a matter of chance that Whitney became involved with cotton growing. After
					graduating from Yale University in 1792 with hopes of becoming a lawyer, he traveled to
					South Carolina to accept a job as a tutor. His landlady owned a plantation and raised some
					cotton. After getting into a discussion with several plantation owners about the fact there
					was no economical method of separating seeds from cotton fiber, Whitney recognized it could
					be done mechanically.</p>
				<p>
					He spent the next few months building a prototype. The gin itself comprised a rotating drum
					with wire hooks or ratchet-like teeth that pulled cotton fibers between the teeth of a comb.
					The comb had teeth spaced too closely for seeds to pass through. Only one aspect of the
					machine can be regarded as serious mechanisms design. A second drum, rotating faster than
					the first and carrying brushes, served to dislodge the cotton fibers from the first. This
					was driven, along with the larger drum, by a belt-and-pulley arrangement typically having a
					four-to-one ratio. Cotton bolls were loaded into a hopper, which guided them to the face of
					the comb. After being pulled through by the toothed cylinder, the separated cotton fibers
					emerged at the left and the seeds collected to the right.</p>
				<p>
					Whitney&#39;s design was almost immediately stolen and counterfeited a vast number of times.
					After years of patent litigation he received only a tiny fraction of the wealth to which he
					was entitled. He continued to invent. Ten years later, because of his reputation as an
					innovator, he won a government contract to produce 10,000 muskets&mdash;a previously
					unheard-of number. To manufacture the gun locks, Whitney invented the milling machine that
					is the staple of machine shop production today.</p>
				<p>
					Although Whitney&rsquo;s invention only involved a few hundred kilograms of matter, it
					shaped the future of a nation and its people; it is rare that a single contrivance has such
					a profound social effect.</p>
