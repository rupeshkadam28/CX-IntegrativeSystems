                                critical. Effective communication among team members and outside stakeholders is
                                essential. But training is needed even more to master technology and ensure business

                                surprisingly, the researchers found that people project their own biases on robots.
                                Perhaps more surprisingly, robots are learning negative biases toward humans through the
