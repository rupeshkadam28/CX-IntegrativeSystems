                    The extremely loud environment at a steel plant precluded transferring information about
                    critical machine processes over walky-talkies. Each time an operation stopped or
                    started, the operator returned to the control room to gather data.&nbsp;What if the
                    operating engineer could deliver that same control room data right on the factory floor
                    using a hands-free wearable device?</p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Advanced wearable technologies when coupled with a robust sensor package and
                    augmented reality, have been proven to increase productivity and workplace
                    safety,&rdquo; says Brian Mullins, founder and CEO of <a
                        href="http://daqri.com/home/product/daqri-smart-helmet/" target="_blank"
                        title="DAQRI">DAQRI</a>, a Los Angeles-based enterprise augmented reality company,
                    which has developed a smart helmet designed to reduce operational complexity, increase
                    productivity, and improve work life in an industrial workplace.</p>
                <p>
                    DAQRI&rsquo;s smart helmet is an Industrial Internet of Things (<a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/events/iot" target="_blank" title="IoT">IoT</a>) device
                    that increases the connectivity between people, data, and machines, says Mullins. It
                    enables operating engineers to overlay maps, schematics and thermal images to see
                    through walls, pipes, and other solid objects. &ldquo;The helmet can also provide an
                    immense amount of data back to the industrial <a

                    servers,&nbsp;specifically, things like photographs, videos, thermal and environmental
                    noise
                    monitoring, and 3D mapping,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
                <p>
                    The device was pilot-tested last year at the <a href="http://daqri.com/home/case-studies/case-ksp/"
                        target="_blank" title="KSP Steel">KSP Steel plant</a> in Kazakhstan. &ldquo;The analysis showed
                    that
                    by eliminating trips back to the control room, the plant would be able to increase
                    overall productivity by around 40% and reduce factory downtime by 50%,&rdquo; estimates
                    Mullins.</p>

                    Smart Processor</h2>
                <p>
                    The helmet is designed to be rugged and resistant to dust, water, and the wide range of
                    environmental conditions which impact conventional hard helmets. But what&rsquo;s at the
                    core of the helmet that makes it smart?&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    The device, highlights Mullins, is powered by an Intel 6th generation m7 processor and
                    loaded with depth sensors, cameras, inertial measurement units, and an advanced audio
                    system in order to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; the world around it. In addition, a visual
                    heads-up display system enables an <a

                <p>
                    &ldquo;These hardware elements are fused together through a family of algorithms and a
                    mobile software stack,&rdquo; he explains, adding that through these features, the
                    helmet has the ability to map, monitor, and serve up relevant digital information which
                    has been shown to positively impact productivity and safety in the workplace.</p>
                <p>
                    For example, the thermal vision equips users with the ability to see temperature data in
                    their real-world environment. This prevents them from interacting with something at an
                    unsafe temperature. They can also see thermal characteristics of objects or items in the
                    workplace that need maintenance or additional monitoring.</p>

                    Workplace Safety</h2>
                <p>
                    Workplace safety is a key area that the <a

                        title="Preventing Concussions
on the Ice ">helmet</a> has been designed to address. &ldquo;It replaces the necessity to carry auxiliary tools like
                    tablets, books, digital cameras, laptops etc. These types of hand-carried equipment can
                    be dangerous when a worker is performing a task at high altitudes.&nbsp;By having access
                    to this information in a visual space, workers can have their hands free to perform
                    operations or maintain balance,&rdquo; says Mullins.</p>
                <p>
                    Operating engineers are at risk for accidents around heavy machines at the work site,
                    such as a forklift that reverses over someone when their back is turned. The helmet
                    comes equipped with two depth-sensing cameras, facing forward and
                    backward.&nbsp;&ldquo;This enables a person to literally have eyes in the back of their
                    head and signal an audible or visual alarm if an impending dangerous situation is
                    observed,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    The helmet also comes with an optional headband that detects <a

                    level, and frontal lobe brain activity so that focus and cognitive states can be
                    monitored. &ldquo;The combination of this set of sensors can serve as an early warning
                    for a variety of potential health-related danger zones that the worker could be placing
                    themselves in,&rdquo; says Mullins. &nbsp;</p>

                    field service, maintenance, healthcare, and manufacturing roles. However, in a
                    manufacturing setup where engineers are working with complex and heavy machinery, they
                    should not feel uncomfortable while using wearables.</p>
                <p>
                    According to Mullins, DAQRI&rsquo;s device conforms to the standard deviations of
                    existing hard helmet weight and wearability and the pricing varies based on
                    customization/workflow. It is currently in the pilot phase of product roll-out with
                    companies in the fields of oil, gas, power, construction, water, transportation,
                    shipbuilding, and aerospace. &ldquo;Some amount of training will be required for both
                    developers and users,&rdquo; says Mullins. &ldquo;But the benefits to worker training
                    are astronomical.&rdquo;</p>
