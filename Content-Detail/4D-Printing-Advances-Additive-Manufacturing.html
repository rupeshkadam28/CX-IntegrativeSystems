                <p>&ldquo;4D&rdquo; printing is an emerging technology that 3D-prints solid components
                    programmed to change into other shapes when certain environmental parameters -
                    temperature, light, and humidity &ndash; are reached. Thus, the &ldquo;fourth
                    dimension&rdquo; is, literally, transformation. This ability depends on the development
                    and use of unique programmable materials. Although 4D printing is still an emerging
                    field, it has huge potential for expanding engineering design.</p>

                        printing</a> requires complex and time-consuming post-processing steps to
                    mechanically program each component. Also, most commercial printers can only print 4D
                    using a single material, which greatly limits design choices. But a research team led by
                    Jerry Qi, a mechanical engineering professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, along
                    with scientists at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, have developed a
                    powerful new 4D printer that can create self-assembling 4D-structures much more quickly
                    and efficiently.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;We call it the multi-material multi-method [m4] 3D printer,&rdquo; Qi says.
                    &ldquo;It is a very powerful 3D printing system that integrates four printing methods
                    into one single platform, which enables the efficient printing of complicated parts that
                    can change shape, thus expanding future printing applications.&rdquo;</p>

                        target="_blank" title="New 4-D printer could reshape the world we live in">Their
                        paper</a> about the technology was recently published in <em>ScienceDaily.</em></p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>

                <p>Qi&rsquo;s printer combines four different printing technologies: aerosol, inkjet, direct
                    ink write, and fused deposition modeling. It can make products from a variety of
                    materials including hydrogels, conductive inks, elastomers, and shape memory polymers,
                    which can be programmed to &quot;remember&quot; a shape and then transform into it when
                    heated to a certain temperature.</p>

                <p>Using his printer and a special composite material made from acrylic and epoxy, Qi
                    successfully 4D-printed objects that transformed shape up to 90 percent faster than
                    previously possible because the tedious mechanical programming steps were already
                    integrated into the 3D printing process. Composites can offer significantly improved
                    physical properties and greater functionality, compared to single materials.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;When two or more materials that respond differently to environmental stimuli are
                    combined together into a composite material, there will be some incompatibility in the
                    structure,&rdquo; Qi says. &ldquo;We can thus harness this incompatibility and design
                    structures that can dramatically change in shape.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>For <a
                        href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/environmental-engineering/a-new-class-of-polymers"
                        title="A New Class of Polymers">multiple polymers</a>, their
                    property-structure-processing relationships can be very complicated and very
                    material-specific. For example, Qi combined an elastomer and a glassy polymer to create
                    a one-way 4D printing transformation, where the shape is permanent and cannot change
                    upon later cooling or heating. In another case, Qi combined an elastomer and a liquid
                    crystal elastomer to create a product with a reversible shape capability, where the
                    shape can change back and forth with changes in temperature.</p>

                <p>A key engineering challenge in designing the system was the integration of the control
                    modules for the different printing methods. The printer is controlled by an
                    in-houseDeveloped software platform using Python code.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;So, you can hit one button and then the printing job starts, without human
                    intervention in the middle of the printing process for multiple material and multiple
                    methods printing,&rdquo; Qi says. &ldquo;This requires very careful design of software,
                    including passing control commands to different printing modules, transforming
                    coordinate systems when different printing methods are used, and coordinating printing
                    layer thickness.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The system also requires a very large, 6,000-pound granite table. &ldquo;This is because
                    we need to shuttle the printing platform to different printing modules and the
                    zDirection variations must be within three microns,&rdquo; Qi says. &ldquo;Any steel
                    board will warp more than 3 microns when the temperature changes slightly. Thus, only a
                    large piece of granite provides the stability to maintain such accuracy.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3>Future Possibilities Abound</h3>

                <p>When most people see the m4 printer for the first time, the &ldquo;aha&rdquo; moment is
                    when they realize the level of integration it takes to combine four different printing
                    capabilities into one single printing platform. Qi is collaborating with several
                    companies to see how the m4 printer might be helpful in solving some of their unique
                    product design challenges. He is also working with Children&#39;s Healthcare of Atlanta
                    to determine whether this new technology can print prosthetic devices for children.</p>

                <p>&quot;We are on the cusp of creating a <a

                        title="New 3D Printer Extruder Takes Manufacturing to Next Level">new generation of
                        devices</a> that could vastly expand the practical applications for 3D and 4D
                    printing,&quot; says Qi. &quot;Our prototype printer integrates many features that
                    appear to simplify and expedite the processes used in traditional 3D printing. As a
                    result, we can use a variety of materials to create hard and soft components at the same
                    time, even incorporating conductive wiring directly into shape-changing structures, and
                    ultimately set the stage for the development of a host of 4D products that could reshape
                    our world.&quot;</p>
