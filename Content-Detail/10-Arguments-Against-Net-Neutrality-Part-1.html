                            <p>The internet was born free, without restrictions and regulation. Then broadband providers
                                starting exerting control through steps like slowing down video streams, especially with
                                bandwidth hog Netflix dominating internet traffic.</p>

                            <p>Users were upset at the slower video streams, and the government stepped in to take
                                control of the internet from broadband providers.&nbsp;Net neutrality today is
                                associated with a broad set of rules established in 2015 stopping broadband providers
                                from blocking selected content, or slowing down internet speeds for customers. But those
                                rules will be repealed starting April 23 by the Republican-dominated U.S. Federal
                                Communications Commission.</p>

                            <p>The worry is that a repeal will put control of the internet back in the hands of
                                broadband providers. Opponents of net neutrality argue the internet should not be
                                regulated as it will stall innovation and investment in next-generation technologies.

                            <p>The net neutrality debate today is mostly around <a
                                    href="https://community.asme.org/futureme/w/wiki/12371.futureme-video-series.aspx">video</a>,
                                but could pivot to IoT, which will increase its share of internet traffic in the future.
                                The number of connected IoT devices is expected to reach 125 billion by 2030, according
                                to IHS, and the repeal could impact companies involved in smart medical devices,
                                autonomous cars, drones, connected factories and smart city projects. Here are five
                                arguments for and five against the repeal that engineers need to know, especially in the
                                context of IoT.</p>

                            <p><strong>FOR</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>1) Prioritize IoT communications:</strong> With the repeal, Internet providers
                                will be able to be prioritize internet traffic. For example, communication between
                                autonomous cars or life-saving medical devices could be prioritized and put on the fast
                                lane, while non-essential traffic could be placed with regular internet communications.
                                This could also benefit other <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/filling-the-talent-gap">IoT-based
                                    services</a>. &quot;Wearables, delivery drones, and driverless cars are among the
                                &#39;killer apps&#39; that require a lot of real-time data and would benefit from
                                preferential treatment in areas with strained network capacity,&quot; PwC wrote in a
                                research report.</p>

                            <p><strong>2) More investment and new services:</strong> Broadband providers have been
                                reluctant to invest in infrastructure or develop innovative services since net
                                neutrality regulations went into effect in 2015, says George Ford, chief economist at
                                the Phoenix Center for Advanced Legal and Economic Public Policy Studies. Broadband
                                providers&rsquo; capital expenditure declined to $76 billion [B] in 2016 from the
                                decade-high $78.4 billion in 2014, according to USTelecom.</p>

                            <p>Telecom companies can recoup investments quicker by developing innovative premium
                                services around security, artificial intelligence or even specialized IoT traffic like
                                tracking. Beyond provisioning traffic, a lot of computing services for IoT like image
                                recognition can be provided on the edge equipment of telecom and network providers.
                                However, regulations and red tape could discourage those investments as the return will
                                be slower, Ford says.</p>

                            <p><strong>3) Fast track factory and infrastructure upgrades:</strong> <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/topics/designmanufacturing">Manufacturers</a> are
                                increasingly connected to the internet, and a robust telecom infrastructure is a must to
                                keep factories up to date, Robyn Boerstling, vice president of infrastructure,
                                innovation and human resources policy of National Association of Manufacturers, told
                                ASME.</p>

                            <p>&quot;Continued investment in networks, led by the private sector, allow for improvements
                                and upgrades that keep economic growth moving in a positive direction and give the U.S.
                                a competitive advantage. A regulatory regime that holds back the development and
                                deployment of the latest manufacturing technology would be a step in the wrong
                                direction,&rdquo; Boerstling says.</p>

                            <p><strong>4) Limited regulation:</strong> The Internet evolved with time, first as a
                                platform for people to communicate, then for e-commerce, and now as a harbinger for
                                emerging technologies like IoT, artificial intelligence, <a
                                    href="https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/technology-and-society/10-top-emerging-technologies-part-1">blockchain</a>
                                and cloud. Companies like AT&amp;T &ndash; which hasn&rsquo;t taken a stand on net
                                neutrality &ndash; has argued that regulations could stall development of new internet
                                technologies.</p>

                            <p>&quot;In the very near future, technological advances like self-driving cars, remote
                                surgery and augmented reality will demand even greater performance from the
                                internet,&rdquo; AT&amp;T says. &ldquo;Without predictable rules for how the internet
                                works, it will be difficult to meet the demands of these new technology advances.&rdquo;
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>5) 5G development:</strong> Government interference will hinder the development
                                of 5G, which will drive autonomous cars, robots and haptic feedback-enabled drones, says
                                networking equipment maker Ericsson in a filing with the FCC. &quot;Inflexible rules
                                could undermine the diverse 5G use cases and innovation enabled by quality-of-service
                                distinctions and the availability of different levels of connectivity that could be made
                                available as part of broadband Internet access offerings,&quot; Ericsson says. 5G is a
                                melting pot of wireless technologies that will also allow sensors and machines to
                                directly talk over long distances, and net neutrality&rsquo;s repeal could pave a path
                                for companies to separate critical data traffic that may be important to factory safety,
                                as an example.</p>
