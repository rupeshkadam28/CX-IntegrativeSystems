                            batteries every day to charge our smartphones, laptops, and many other electronics. One

                            capacity of lithium-ion batteries has struggled to keep up with the surging demands for
                            their use.</p>

                        <p>Now, engineers at Carnegie Mellon University say they&rsquo;ve found a way to
                            significantly extend lithium-ion battery life by using a new method to print 3-D
                            electrodes.</p>

                        <p>The lattice printing 3-D method could not only extend battery life, it could serve to
                            create batteries made from materials like silicon, which would give the batteries faster
                            recharging times and, when used in electric cars, longer range time. The low-weight and
                            high-energy-capacity batteries the printing method create could also power small, light
                            devices, like <a

                        <p>All batteries contain two metal electrodes, a negatively charged anode and the positively
                            charged cathode, separated by a substance called the electrolyte. A lithium-ion battery,
                            or Li-ion battery, is a rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the
                            negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge, and then move back when
                            charging</p>

                        <p>The Carnegie Mellon team&rsquo;s electrodes are printed using Aerosol Jet technology,
                            which assembles droplets one-by-one to create electrodes with lattice-like, interlaced
                            structures with complex geometries that can be created using the current
                            electrode-printing methods, said Rahul Panat, associate professor of mechanical
                            engineering at the university.</p>

                        <p>Right now, lithium-ion battery electrodes are 3-D printed through an extrusion method
                            that lays down &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; of the material one atop the other to form a solid
                            block of material. Lithium has a hard time penetrating that solid block to charge the
                            electrode, Panat said.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Lithium has to penetrate throughout volume of electrode for it to be fully
                            utilized,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s commercially available batteries, you
                            have about 30 to 50 percent of the lithium used.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>The chemical, on the other hand, can easily diffused throughout the channels and pores of
                            the latticed electrode to completely saturate the electrode. The researchers have found
                            that lithium saturates 100 percent of the battery&rsquo;s electrode when it&rsquo;s
                            printed using their technique.</p>

                        <p>Panut worked with Jonghyun Park, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at
                            Missouri University of Science and Technology to develop the new printing method.</p>

                        <p>Because it has more energy storage capacity, the latticed electrode can be used to make a
                            smaller battery that still carries the same charging capability of its larger,
                            solid-electrode counterpart.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Or it could make the same-size battery that would hold much more charge,&rdquo;
                            Panat said.</p>

                        <p>Another benefit of the new process is that electrodes could now be created from widely
                            available materials like silicone and oxide, which can store five to ten times more
                            energy than the graphite lithium-ion batteries used today, Panat said. But that poses
                            its own set of problems.</p>

                        <p>Because silicon can hold 10 times more lithium atoms, it expands significantly when
                            charged.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;In the very first charging cycle, the silicon-electrode battery inside the test
                            vehicle would expand to three times its original volume and crack. The battery would be
                            dead,&rdquo; Panat said. &ldquo;The very fact these materials can hold more lithium
                            becomes the reason for their cracking. It&rsquo;s ironic. So stress relief is extremely
                            important.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>To overcome that, the team added channels and pillars to the electrodes, which keep the
                            battery from expanding. The lithium saturates the electrode, so it has no need to
                            expand.</p>

                        <p>The new electrode-printing method could be commercialized in about four years, Panat
                            said.</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Right now, we&rsquo;re evaluating different materials, different use conditions,
                            and looking at how many recharge cycles these batteries would work for,&rdquo; he said.
