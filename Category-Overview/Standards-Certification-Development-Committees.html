			<p><strong>In this section, learn more about joining or interacting with an ASME Standards &amp;
					Certification (S&amp;C) Development Committee.</strong></p>
			<p>ASME&#39;s standards are developed by technical committees &ndash; mechanical engineers and others who
				represent various facets of their industries, from manufacturers and installers to insurers, inspectors,
				distributors, regulatory agencies and end users. ASME offers interested parties an opportunity to
				participate in our standards development process regardless of nationality or residency.</p>
			<p>Currently, more than 5,000 technical experts from around the world work with ASME worldwide to publish
				some 550 standards. These professionals play a vital role in defining the norms and benchmarks of their
				industries and of mechanical engineering.</p>

					<p class="mt-2"><strong>Standards Development Principles</strong></p>
					<p>Participation on ASME&#39;s standards developing committees is free and open to technically qualified
						individuals with a willingness and ability to contribute.</p>
					<p>ASME&#39;s standards development process operates on key principles including:</p>
					<ul class="primary-list">
						<li>Openness</li>
						<li>Transparency</li>
						<li>Inclusion/Balance of interest</li>
						<li>Due process</li>
						<li>Consensus</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These principles are consistent with those established by the World Trade Organization&#39;s Technical
						Barriers to Trade Committee.</p>

					<p class="mt-2"><strong>Committee Procedures, Policies and Guidelines</strong></p>
					<p>ASME standards development activities are conducted according to

					<p class="mt-2"><strong>Web Based Participation </strong></p>
					<p>ASME understands that involving leading professionals worldwide is key to developing technically sound,
						market-relevant standards. To that end, we developed a comprehensive set of electronic tools that enable
						members to participate in the standards development process regardless of their physical location on a
						24/7
						basis. Anchored by <a href="http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/index.cfm" title="">C&amp;S Connect</a>
						these
						tools also ensure effective communication and procedural management throughout that standards development
						process.</p>
