                    <p>ASME aims to be the essential resource for mechanical engineers and other technical

                    <h3 id="Culture">Our Culture</h3>
                    <p>As we grow as an organization, it has become more and more important to explicitly
                        define
                        the core values from which we develop our culture, our brand, and our business
                        strategies. These are some of the core values that we live by: embrace and drive
                        change;
                        be accountable; be creative, and open-minded; pursue growth and learning; be honest
                        and
                        transparent. We set high standards and we share our expectations with each other and
                        strive to maintain a workplace built on mutual values, trust and goodwill.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the core values that we live by: embrace and drive change; be
                        accountable; be creative, and open-minded; pursue growth and learning; be honest and
                        transparent.</p>
                    <h3 id="Diversity">Diversity & Inclusion</h3>
                    <p>We're more than just an equal opportunity employer; our commitment to diversity makes
                        us
                        who we are. We've created an environment that celebrates differences and lets
                        individuality thrive.</p>
                    <p>Diversity and Inclusion at ASME encompasses Diversity of Experience (including
                        personal
                        and professional experiences; family and lifestyle backgrounds; socioeconomic
                        backgrounds); Diversity of Thought (including work styles; personality types; and
                        skill-sets); and Diversity of Demographic Groups (including age, religion, gender,
                        national origin, race ethnicity, color, disability, sexual orientation and veteran's
                        status).</p>
                    <p>At its essence, diversity and inclusion means fully embracing the potential of our
                        staff,
                        acknowledging our diversity and our commonalities, fostering creativity and talent
                        in
                        the workplace and facilitating more effective engagement with each other. While it
                        is
                        important to acknowledge and appreciate our differences, we must also recognize our
                        shared goal of professional excellence and our commitment to ASME's mission and
                        vision.
