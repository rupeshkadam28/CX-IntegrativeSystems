<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>To serve diverse global communities by advancing, disseminating and applying
    engineering
    knowledge for improving the quality of life; and communicating the excitement of
    engineering.</p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>ASME aims to be the essential resource for mechanical engineers and other technical
    professionals throughout the world for solutions that benefit humankind.</p>
<h3 id="Culture">Our Culture</h3>
<p>As we grow as an organization, it has become more and more important to explicitly
    define
    the core values from which we develop our culture, our brand, and our business
    strategies. These are some of the core values that we live by: embrace and drive
    change;
    be accountable; be creative, and open-minded; pursue growth and learning; be honest
    and
    transparent. We set high standards and we share our expectations with each other and
    strive to maintain a workplace built on mutual values, trust and goodwill.</p>
<p>These are some of the core values that we live by: embrace and drive change; be

<h3 >Diversity & Inclusion</h3>
<p>We're more than just an equal opportunity employer; our commitment to diversity makes
    us
    who we are. We've created an environment that celebrates differences and lets
    individuality thrive.</p>
<p>Diversity and Inclusion at ASME encompasses Diversity of Experience (including
    personal
    and professional experiences; family and lifestyle backgrounds; socioeconomic
    backgrounds); Diversity of Thought (including work styles; personality types; and
    skill-sets); and Diversity of Demographic Groups (including age, religion, gender,
    national origin, race ethnicity, color, disability, sexual orientation and veteran's
    status).</p>
<p>At its essence, diversity and inclusion means fully embracing the potential of our
    staff,
    acknowledging our diversity and our commonalities, fostering creativity and talent
    in
    the workplace and facilitating more effective engagement with each other. While it
    is
    important to acknowledge and appreciate our differences, we must also recognize our
    shared goal of professional excellence and our commitment to ASME's mission and
    vision.
