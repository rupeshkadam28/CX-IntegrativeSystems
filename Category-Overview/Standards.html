<h2>About Codes and Standards</h2>
<p>
    ASME is the leading international developer of codes and standards associated
    with the art, science, and practice of mechanical engineering. Starting with the
    first issuance of its legendary Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code in 1914, ASME's
    codes and standards have grown to nearly 600 offerings currently in print. These
    offerings cover a breadth of topics, including pressure technology, nuclear
    plants, elevators / escalators, construction, engineering design,
    standardization, and performance testing.
</p>
<p>
    Developing and revising ASME codes and standards occurs year-round. More than
    4,700 dedicated volunteers — engineers, scientists, government officials, and
    others — contribute their technical expertise to protect public safety, while
    reflecting best practices of industry. The results of their efforts are being
    used in over 100 nations; thus setting the standard for code-development
    worldwide.
</p>
<p>
    ASME develops voluntary standards that enhance public safety, health, and
    quality of life as well as facilitate innovation, trade, and
    competitiveness.</p>
    <p> ASME develops and revises standards based on market needs through a consensus
    process whose meetings dealing with standards-related actions are open to all
    members of the public. ASME consensus committees are comprised of volunteer
    subject matter experts from a diverse range of interests, including
    manufacturers, users, government, and general interest. ASME standards and
    subsequent revisions are based upon review of reliable technical data by the
    consensus committee and its sub-tier committees.</p>
    <p>The ASME process includes a broad public review for all of its standards
    actions. Any interested member of the general public may review and comment on
    proposed ASME standards or revisions, as well as initiate an appeal based on
    previously submitted concerns. ASME's voluntary standards may be adopted by
    jurisdictional authorities as a means of complying with their governing
    regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>ASME standards are accepted for use in more than 100 countries around the world.</p>

<h3><a href="/shop/certification-accreditation">Certification and Accreditation</a></h3>
<p>ASME conformity assessment programs—under which a company or an individual is
    assessed and certified based on demonstrated ability to meet the requirements of
    an ASME standard—continue to provide a vital service to enhancement of public
    safety and facilitation of international commerce.</p>

<h3><a href="http://stllc.asme.org/">Facilitating the Commercialization of Innovative Technologies</a></h3>
<p>Developers of innovative technologies oftentimes face the challenge of gaining
    market acceptance; standards can serve as a vital tool for building trust
    between producers and consumers and for providing access to global markets. ASME
    Standards Technology, LLC (ASME ST-LLC) was established to facilitate the
    standardization of innovative technology, by initiating and managing leading
    edge research projects essential to standards development.
