<h3>130 Years and Counting</h3>
<h3>ASME was founded in 1880 to provide a setting for engineers
        to discuss the concerns brought</h3>
<p>by the rise of industrialization and
        mechanization. The
        Society’s founders were some of the more prominent
        machine builders and technical innovators of the late
        nineteenth century; led by prominent steel engineer
        Alexander Lyman Holley, Henry Rossiter Worthington and
        John Edison Sweet.</p>
<p>Holley chaired the first meeting, which was held
        in the New
        York editorial offices of the American Machinist, on
        February 16th, with thirty people in attendance. From
        this date onward, the society ran formal meetings to
        discuss development of standard tools and machine parts
        as well as
        uniform work practices. However, it wasn’t until 1905
        that a major turning point gave new definition to ASME’s
        purpose and impact on civilian life.</p>
<p>Steam powered the technology of the late 19th
        century.
        Despite their power, boilers and pressure vessels were
        temperamental, requiring constant attention and
        maintenance. Although there were numerous boiler
        explosions throughout the 19th century, there were no
        legal codes for boilers in any state in the Union.
        Undoubtedly one of the most important incidents that
        proved the need for developing boiler laws was the
        Grover Shoe Factory Disaster in Brockton, Massachusetts
        on March 10, 1905.</p>
<p>An older boiler, used as a backup during
        maintenance on the
        newer model, exploded, rocketing through three floors
        and the building’s roof. Broken beams and heavy
        machinery trapped many workers who survived the initial
        explosion and collapse. Burning coals thrown from the
        boiler landed throughout the crumbling superstructure,
        starting fires that were fed by broken gas lines. The
        explosion resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries.</p>
<p>It was this catastrophe that gave Massachusetts
        the
        impetus to establish a five-man Board of Boiler Rules,
        whose charge was to write a boiler law for the state;
        this board published its boiler laws in 1908.</p>
<p>Having established the Boiler Testing Code in
        1884, ASME
        formed a Boiler Code Committee in 1911 that led to the
        Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) being published
        in 1915. The BPVC was later incorporated into laws in
        most US states and territories and Canadian provinces.
</p>
<p>ASME’s rich publication history—including
        standards, theory,
        and technical journals—made a great deal of technical
        and biographical information available to engineers and
        policy makers. These publications form a substantial and
        tangible connection to the past that proves
        inspirational to ASME members to this day.</p>

<h3>Setting the Standard</h3>
<p>ASME is best known for improving the safety of
        equipment used in manufacturing and construction,
        particularly boilers and pressure vessels. One founding
        interest was ensuring reliability and predictability in
        machine design and mechanical production. Boilers and
        pressure vessels were an innovation that advanced
        long-range transportation and heavy lifting in ways that
        had never been possible before. However, the machinery
        was temperamental, and frequent corner cutting and
        delayed servicing had disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>ASME published the Boiler &amp;
        Pressure Vessel
        Code (BPVC) in 1915, which was later incorporated into
        laws in most North American territories. In the years
        following the publication of the first BPVC, ASME
        continued the proliferation of safety in industry,
        developing engineering standards in numerous technical
        areas including pipeline production, elevators and
        escalators, materials handling, gas turbines, and
        nuclear power. Today, ASME has more than 600 codes and
        standards available in print and online.</p>
