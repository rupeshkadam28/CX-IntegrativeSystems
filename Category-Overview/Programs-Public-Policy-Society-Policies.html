        <h6>Clean Energy</h6>
        <p> A balanced portfolio of energy supplies can meet the nation’s
            energy
            needs. This includes advanced clean coal, petroleum, nuclear,
            natural
            gas, waste-to energy, biomass, solar, wind and hydroelectric
            power.

        <h6>R&D Cross-Cutting and Emerging
            Technologies</h6>
        <p> Engineers have a long-standing interest in applying their
            knowledge
            to improve the environment and human health. The U.S. must
            invest in
            both the research and education that will empower engineers to
            solve
            looming environmental challenges.

        <h6>Pressure Technology</h6>
        <p> ASME is the global leader on the design, analysis, materials,
            fabrication, construction, inspection, operation, and failure
            prevention of a variety of pressure technology applications.
            ASME’s
            pressure technology codes and standards are used in over 100
            countries around to improve public health and safety outcomes
            and
            promote the quality, reliability, and suitability of pressure
            technology products and services.
