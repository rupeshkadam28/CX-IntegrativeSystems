        <p> ASME Government Relations recently hosted an exciting new webinar about what it is like to
          be an ASME Fellow in Congress, featuring two Fellows&mdash;one in the U. S. Senate and
          another in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Fellows provided valuable personal insight
          on their experiences working on Capitol Hill from the office environment to the personality
          traits of those who thrive in this demanding environment from speaking to constituents on
          behalf of their Member of Congress to performing research for a bill and gathering political
          support.</p>
        <p> ASME has the unique distinction of being the first engineering/scientific society to
          establish a Congressional Fellowship program. For the past 44 years, ASME has provided a
          valuable service to the nation by sponsoring over 119 Federal Fellows who have served in the
          Executive and Legislative Branches of Government. ASME Federal Government Fellowships have
          enabled selected ASME members to devote a year working in government providing engineering
          and technical advice to policy makers in Congress, Federal agencies, and the White House. A

          <li>The NNMI is the U.S. Federal Government program for coordinating public and private investments to
            improve the competitiveness and productivity of U.S. manufacturing through the creation of a robust
            network of manufacturing innovation institutes, each focused on a specific and promising advanced
            manufacturing technology area. The NNMI Program advances American manufacturing innovation by creating
            an effective research and development, technology transition, workforce training and education outreach
            infrastructure for U.S. industry and academia to solve industry-relevant manufacturing problems. The
            vision of the NNMI Program is a network of institutes that bring U.S. industry, academia, and government
            together to solve pre-competitive cross-sector manufacturing challenges that an individual entity cannot
            solve alone. Currently, there are nine manufacturing innovation institutes. These nine institutes are,
            in chronological order:
            <ol class="number">
              <li>America Makes: The National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (additive manufacturing/3D
                printing), August 2012.</li>
              <li>DMDII: Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (digital manufacturing and design),
                February 2014.</li>
              <li>LIFT: Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (lightweight metals manufacturing), February 2014.</li>
              <li>PowerAmerica: The Next Generation Power Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Institute (wide
                bandgap power electronics manufacturing), December 2014.</li>
              <li>IACMI: Institute of Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (fiber-reinforced polymer
                composites), June 2015.</li>
              <li>AIM Photonics: American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (integrated photonics
                manufacturing), July 2015.</li>
              <li>NextFlex: America’s Flexible Hybrid Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Institute (thin flexible
                electronic devices and sensors), August 2015.</li>
              <li>AFFOA: Advanced Functional Fabrics of America (advanced fibers and textiles), April 2016.</li>
              <li>Manufacturing Innovation Institute on Smart Manufacturing: Advanced Sensors, Controls, Platforms
                and Modeling for Manufacturing (selection announced June 2016)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The institutes, each led by manufacturing experts renowned in their field, have attracted nearly 1,000
          companies, universities and nonprofits as members. The federal government’s commitment of more than $600
          million to the nine institutes has been matched by more than $1.2 billion in non-federal resources from
          across industry, academia and state governments. In addition to the institutes listed above, five
          competitions are running to create manufacturing hubs, with a national impact, in the areas of robotics
          for manufacturing, biofabrication of cells and tissues, chemical process intensification, revolutionizing
          the ways materials can be reused and recycled, and the first open topic competition in which the proposing
          team picks the focus of a new institute. Nearly $800 million in combined federal and non-federal resources
          will be invested in these institutes to support the development and dissemination of transformative
          manufacturing technologies. These new institutes will be sponsored by the Department of Commerce (DOC),
          the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Department of Energy (DOE). Throughout its growth, the network
          will continue to be guided by both its public and private members, and the federal agencies with interests
          in manufacturing, including the DOE, the DoD, the DOC, the Department of Education (DOEd), the Department
          of Agriculture (USDA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation
          Administration (FAA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF).
          While significant progress has been made, the grand challenge for the US to achieve global leadership is
          to establish 45 institutes over the next decade</p>
