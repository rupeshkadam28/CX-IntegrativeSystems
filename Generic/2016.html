                <h2>Leonard Harris</h2>
                <p>Leonard (Len) Harris was born in Yeppoon, Queensland, Australia on July 12, 1927. His father,
                    Joseph Harris, was a first generation Irish Australian and followed his father as a miner.
                    His mother, Edith Beatrice Littlejohns, was a first generation Cornish Australian. </p>

                <p>In 1937 Len&rsquo;s family moved to Mt. Morgan. Len completed his primary and high school
                    education in Mt. Morgan and enrolled in the Mt. Morgan Technical College to study
                    metallurgy. During this time, he hired on to Mt. Morgan Ltd. as a Cadet Metallurgist under
                    an indentured six-year period. All tuition, fees and books were paid for by the company.
                    While working as a Cadet Metallurgist, he spent most of his time as an Assayer/Chemist. In
                    1949 Len received a Diploma in Metallurgy from the Queensland Department of Education and
                    was promoted to Research Metallurgist.</p>

                <p>Mt. Morgan Ltd. was a significant producer of copper. During World War II, the employees were
                    exempt from the draft as this operation was considered to be a &ldquo;protected
                    industry&rdquo;. Employees were expected, however, to take part in civil duties and Len
                    joined both the town and the company fire brigades. Mt. Morgan was a very generous company
                    with respect to community aid. During his employment at Mt. Morgan, Len experienced the
                    value of a company that was engaged in the community and the lives of the employees as well
                    as others in the surrounding communities. However, Len also saw firsthand issues like acid
                    rock drainage and polluted rivers and waterways, which left an impression on him. Len also
                    experienced a severe work place accident that put him in the hospital. These were
                    experiences, which helped form Len&rsquo;s values and passions that drove his career to
                    making &ldquo;mines safer and more responsible.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>In 1951 Len went to work at Mt. Isa Ltd. in Mt. Isa Queensland. He worked there for two years
                    as an Assayer/Chemist, and as a Mill Shift Boss. Len was attracted to Mt. Isa because they
                    paid a bonus tied to the sales price of lead. Mt. Isa Ltd. was also a very generous company
                    with respect to community assistance. They built swimming pools, playgrounds, recreational
                    parks and a golf course. </p>

                <p>In 1953 Len took up the position of Metallurgical Engineer at the Radium Hill Uranium Project
                    in South Australia. Radium Hill was located in the desert west of the big mining town of
                    Broken Hill. Radium Hill was owned by the South Australia government and overseen by the
                    Australian and U.S. Atomic Energy Commissions. The entire operation was top secret. </p>

                <p>Later in 1953, Len left Australia and made his way to London, where he accepted a job in the
                    Gold Coast as a Technical Officer with Taquah &amp; Abosso Mines Ltd. The contract was only
                    for 15 months working in a gold plant. </p>

                <p>Len left the Gold Coast in 1955, and went on to Lima, Peru. Len traveled to La Oroya by
                    train. La Oroya at 3,000 meters altitude was the center of Cerro de Pasco Corporation mining
                    operations. Len started as a Research Metallurgist and was quickly promoted to
                    Senior<strong> </strong>Hydrometallurgist. He went to work in the smelters as Lead Smelter
                    Metallurgist, Copper Smelter Metallurgist, Deputy Lead Superintendent, Copper Smelter
                    Superintendent, and finally as Director of Metallurgy. In this position Len had 30
                    metallurgists from all over the world working for him on a variety of projects in the
                    concentrators, smelters and refineries. Cerro de Pasco Corporation produced a host of base
                    metals and rare metals. This was one of the most complex metallurgical operations in the
                    world -- receiving ores and concentrates from their five other Peruvian operations,
                    concentrates from other Peruvian mines and from mines overseas.</p>

                <p>Cerro de Pasco Corporation engaged in extensive community assistant services for the families
                    of the employees. The workers were allocated free housing, free health services and free
                    schooling and sporting facilities. The staff occupied subsidized housing and enjoyed free
                    schooling and health programs. There was a large department of social workers engaged in
                    these programs. </p>

                <p>In 1956 Len met a nurse from the company hospital, Rosa Haydee Navarro Talavera, at a company
                    dance. They married in 1957 and are still married today, 60 years later.</p>

                <p>During his 16 years at Cerro de Pasco Len saw many good things but he also experienced some
                    very difficult times in worker strikes and attempts to overthrow the government. Len
                    gathered these experiences and his passion and desire to operate a mine with fair treatment
                    and providing benefits to the community continued to grow, knowing &ldquo;that we can do
                    better.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Len left Peru in 1971 and returned to Australia as Mine Manager of Texada Mines Ltd.
                    Texada&rsquo;s operations were located at Lake McLoud, a dried up lake some 50 miles from
                    the city of Carnavon in West Australia with 4,400 acres of evaporation ponds and a wash
                    plant. The salt was transported in trucks 15 miles to the company-owned port of Cape Cuvier
                    and loaded on ships bound for Japan. Len became manager of the salt operations and Port
                    Captain over time. On arrival at Lake McLoud, the plant was producing some 300,000 tons of
                    salt per year. When Len left two years later, it was producing four million tons of salt per
                    year. </p>

                <p>In 1973 Len received an offer from his former company, Cerro de Pasco Corporation, to work in
                    their headquarters in New York City. He travelled between the Peruvian operations and New
                    York but later, worked with a team on a major project involving a new copper smelter and
                    refinery in Pine Bluff, Arkansas and a fluospar mine and mill in Paducah, Kentucky. On
                    January 1, 1974 all the Peruvian operations were nationalized by the Velasco government and
                    the company virtually collapsed. Later in 1974, the entire company was purchased by the
                    Pritzker Group from Chicago, which finally terminated Cerro de Pasco, which had started
                    operations in Peru in 1901. </p>

                <p>In November 1974 Len joined Newmont Mining Corporation in New York City. Len spent 16 years
                    with Newmont initially as a Research Metallurgist at their facilities in Danbury,
                    Connecticut and worked his way to Vice President of Research and Development and Vice
                    President of Metallurgical Operations. During this time, he visited and worked on five
                    continents of the world finding opportunities for new projects and assisting those in
                    existing operations. Len became a Director of Newmont Exploration Ltd., Newmont Mines Ltd.,
                    Newmont Australia Ltd., O&rsquo;okiep Copper Company, and an Alternative Director of
                    Pallabora Mining Company and Tsumeb Corporation in Namibia. </p>

                <p>On July 26, 1992 Newmont decided to put the Yanacocha gold property in Peru into operation
                    together with two partners, namely the BRGM (40%), Buenaventura (20%) and Newmont (40%) as
                    manager. Len was named General Manager of the newly formed Minera Yanacocha Company. He
                    immediately moved to Peru. In a very short period of time from exploration through testing,
                    the first gold bar was produced on August 7, 1993 with the production increasing to 1.0
                    million ounces in 1995 and later expanded to 3.3 million ounces per year.</p>

                <p>On the negative side, however, Peru was in the midst of a civil war and terrorism,
                    orchestrated by The Shining Path and Tupac Amaru. These groups had killed 80,000 people and
                    caused billions of dollars of damage to the Peruvian infrastructure. Roads were in terrible
                    condition across the country, the people were on edge and health care in the general
                    vicinity of the Yanacocha mine operations was extremely limited.</p>

                <p>Len was worried about the communities in close proximity to the mine, so he set up a
                    community assistance program which began with a social/cultural study of the communities,
                    i.e., what were their needs, concerns and aspirations. The results were shocking. A high
                    degree of poverty, malnutrition, and disease existed in both the children and the adults,
                    and scabies and head lice were very prevalent amongst the children. On his own initiative
                    Len hired two doctors to conduct a survey of the villages, which found 70-80 percent of the
                    children suffering from malnutrition. He attacked these problems in a joint venture fashion
                    with the help of the mine owners, government organizations, non-government organizations
                    (NGOs), the military, the churches, and contractors and suppliers of goods and services to
                    the mine. </p>

                <p>Len also requested that his wife, Rosa, assist by forming a Ladies Association, along with
                    his continued guidance and assistance, to help resolve the health and education problems of
                    the children and their families. Rosa, a native Peruvian, eagerly accepted the challenge.
                    This association originally consisted of 12 women and ultimately grew to over 100 women
                    under Rosa and Len&rsquo;s leadership and guidance. Their work spread from 900 children to
                    5,000 children living in the villages and hamlets around the mine. A lunch program was set
                    up and the company was able to receive food supplies from USAID, using the help of US
                    Ambassador Alvin Adams. Minera Yanacocha supplied wood-fired cooking stoves and the
                    community mothers did the cooking. This was well received by the communities and immediately
                    increased the number of children (especially young girls) attending school. The Ladies
                    Association also sponsored school supplies and school furniture for the school children. In
                    order to improve the nutritional program for the school population, a quinoa planning
                    project was introduced and aimed at augmenting the food for the school lunches. Quinoa is
                    widely grown and eaten throughout the Andes of South America. Before this program began at
                    Yanacocha, the local community only used quinoa to feed turkeys and chickens. Quinoa is a
                    high protein grain that grows in high altitudes. The project continues today with large
                    success. </p>

                <p>At the same time, Minera Yanacocha, under Len&rsquo;s direction, installed numerous portable
                    water plants and latrines with the help of C.A.R.E. Clean, potable water was a critical
                    issue in Peru as was identified by the Peruvian Minister of Mines as a priority.</p>

                <p>The Ladies Association continued their work in the communities for ten years which included
                    the start of school vegetable garden plots to help put food in the cooking pots; the
                    treatment of scabies with creams provided by donations from doctors in the U.S.; and
                    increased attention to dental hygiene with tooth brushes and tooth paste, also provided by
                    donations. Another initiative of the ladies&rsquo; health program was the treatment of head
                    lice. Treatments for lice were provided by the Peruvian contract drilling company Geotec.
                    Young military draftees helped by providing haircuts. </p>

                <p>The Ladies Association created a program for the training of midwives in the communities with
                    the help of the School of Obstetricians and Doctors in Cajamarca. They were taught how to
                    deliver and position babies to prevent the high mortality rate of mothers and children at
                    the time of birth and diminish infections by using better antiseptic practices. The program
                    was subsequently passed on to the Cajamarca Regional Hospital. </p>

                <p>High school age children were trained in trade occupations such as carpentry, sewing and
                    dressmaking, basic electricity, bakery and cheese making. As a result of the tremendous
                    success of this program a local village school was officially named Rosa de Harris. Such a
                    gesture of naming a school after any individual in Peru is a rare event. </p>

                <p>The Ladies Association work was carried out with the help and donations of the contractors,
                    suppliers of goods and services and individuals. Meanwhile, the company under Len&rsquo;s
                    leadership and the community relations team were engaged in numerous projects, which
                    included the installation of first aid posts, the repair and building of new schools,
                    upgrading and building roads, planting trees and the reforestation and restoration of the
                    land that had been disturbed during the mining operations. Several excess water treatment
                    plants were also installed to supply water to the farmers. </p>

                <p>The ultimate objective of these programs was to create a peaceful neighborhood to allow the
                    company to operate at ease and to create a sense of sustainability whereby the future lives
                    of the people would be greatly improved. This was not a <strong>hand-out program</strong>
                    but rather a <strong>hand-up program</strong> designed to prevent dependency and
                    paternalism. </p>

                <p>Len stated on numerous occasions, &ldquo;I recommend that all mining companies have a
                    community assistance program modeled after the program at Minera Yanacocha
                    Operations.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Len left Minera Yanacocha at the end of 1994 and was named President and General Manager
                    Newmont Peru and Vice President and General Manager Newmont Latin America. He continued to
                    be based in Peru.</p>

                <p>Len retired from Newmont in mid-1995 and returned to his home in Denver.</p>

                <p>In mid-1996 Len took up another career as a mining company director and consultant. He holds
                    the following positions today, Chairman, Resource Development Inc.; President, B&amp;H Mine
                    Services; Director, Solitario, Resources and Royalty Company; Director, Canarc Resource
                    Corp.; Director, Cardero Resources; and Director, Wealth Minerals. Len currently consults

                    Corporation, Golden Alliance, Morgain Minerals, Aztec Metals, and Endeavour Silver
                    Corporation. </p>
