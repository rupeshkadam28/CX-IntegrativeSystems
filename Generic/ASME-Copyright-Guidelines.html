        <h2>INTRODUCING THE NEW ASME ELECTRONIC COPYRIGHT PROCESS</h2>
        <p>Effective immediately, ASME is implementing a new electronic process for copyright
          submission. This new process gives each author the ability to sign his or
          her copyright form electronically instead of filling out and sending in the
          paper form to ASME. This process underwent Beta testing with a live ASME conference
          and yielded excellent results. Please read thoroughly the section below on
          ASME Electronic Copyright to familiarize yourself with this new process. </p>
        <p><em>&quot;I used your [electronic copyright] system as an author of a paper
            for the Micro/Nanoscale Heat and Mass Transfer Conference to be held
            in Shanghai later this month. I was very pleasantly surprised at the
            ease with which I could enter the data and have the procedures
            completed. It took a very short time and the instructions were clear
            and simple. I look forward to having that ease and simplicity for our
            journal and other conferences.&quot;</em></p>

        <h2 >GENERAL ASME COPYRIGHT GUIDELINES</h2>
        <p><strong>Copyright Assignment</strong>

          ASME requests that authors/copyright owners assign copyright to ASME in order for a
          conference or journal paper to be published by ASME. Authors exempt from this request are
          direct employees of the U.S. Government (i.e., not U.S. Government contractors), whereby
          papers are not subject to copyright protection in the U.S., or non-U.S. government
          employees, whose governments hold the copyright to the paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Who Should Sign</strong>

          Only the copyright owner(s) of the Paper, or an authorized representative, can sign the
          copyright form. If one of the following applies, you may not own the copyright to the paper,
          or you may not be authorized to sign the copyright form, and you may need to have the
          appropriate copyright owner(s) or organization representative sign the form:</p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>You created the Paper within the scope of your employment, and your employer is the
            copyright owner.</li>
          <li>You created the Paper under a U.S. Government or other independent contractor form (See
            section below on &ldquo;Copyright Assignment and U.S. Government Requirements.&rdquo;)
          </li>
          <li>You received a grant that funded your Paper.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please review your company policies regarding copyright, and if you are not authorized to
          sign the form, please forward to the appropriate organization representative. Please review
          applicable company, institutional, and grant policies and your employment/independent
          contractor form to determine who holds the rights to your Paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Designated Authors</strong>

          While all authors should submit a signed form, one designated author may sign on behalf of
          the other authors, but ONLY IF the following criteria apply:</p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>The Designated Author must be an author of the paper and the Designated Author of
            record.</li>
          <li>The Designated Author must have secured written authorization from each author on whose
            behalf he/she is signing.</li>
          <li>The Designated Author must be able to produce such written authorization upon request.
          </li>
          <li>The Designated Author cannot sign on behalf of authors whose papers are owned by their
            respective employers or on behalf of authors employed by U. S. Government contractors,
            the U.S. Federal Government, or non-U.S. governments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>U.S. Government Copyright Requirements</strong>

          If the paper you are submitting was prepared in the course of your direct employment with
          the U.S. Government, please include the following footer on the final PDF version of the
          paper you are submitting:</p>

        <p>&quot;This material is declared a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright
          protection in the United States. Approved for public release; distribution is

        <p>*Employees of organizations that operate under contract to the U.S. Government, such as U.S.
          Government labs, please note the following:</p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>Depending on the policy of your organization and your organization&rsquo;s contract, the
            copyright transfer form should be signed either by you or by an appropriate
            representative from your organization.</li>
          <li>You may be required to include a footer on the final PDF version of your paper
            acknowledging contract information and also the following statement:</li>

          paid-up, irrevocable, worldwide license to publish or reproduce the published form of this
          work, or allow others to do so, for United States Government purposes.&quot;</p>

        <p><strong>Copyright Requirements for Non-U.S Governments</strong>

          If you are directly employed by the Government of a country other than the U.S., and you do
          not have authorization to sign the copyright form, please forward the form to the
          appropriate person.</p>

        <h2 class="big">ASME ELECTRONIC COPYRIGHT GUIDELINES AND PROCESS</h2>
        <p>Effective immediately, ASME is implementing a new electronic process for copyright
          submission.</p>
        <p>In order for the electronic copyright form to be processed correctly, a few procedures must
          be followed:</p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>At abstract submission, the corresponding author must enter all co-author information in
            the Tool with complete and verifiable contact information, including email address and
            telephone number. Incomplete or non-verifiable contact information for all authors may
            prevent you from completing the copyright form, and your paper may not be published in
            the conference proceedings.</li>
          <li>Once a draft paper has been accepted for publication, the corresponding author will not
            be able to change the author lineup or paper title.</li>
          <li>In order to guarantee that your form is verified and your paper is included in the
            conference proceedings, please complete the process as soon as possible. For conference
            papers, as a condition of publication, ASME also requires that you or one of your
            co-authors register, pay any applicable registration fees for that conference, attend,
            and present the paper to your fellow conference attendees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that accepted and approved papers will not be processed for publication without
          receipt of a fully executed, signed, and verified copyright form. If copyright issues are
          not resolved by the specified resolution deadline, your paper may be subject to removal from
          publication in the conference proceedings. Please refer to the Publication Schedule posted
          on the Website of each specific conference.</p>
        <p>Once a draft paper is accepted for publication, each author of the paper will receive an
          email message with a unique link that will take each individual author to a website to
          electronically sign the form.</p>
        <p>If you are an author/copyright owner of the paper or are authorized to sign the copyright
          form on behalf of your employer or organization, the system will take you through the
          signing process.</p>
        <p>If you are an author but your organization owns the copyright to the paper or you are
          delegating signing authorization to a Designated Author, you will need to forward the email
          to that individual.</p>
        <p>The system is highly user friendly and will take you through the process in 30 seconds or
          less.</p>
        <p>Should you have any questions about the new process or about adding your co-authors, either
          now or once the process has started, please contact <a
            href="mailto:copyright@asme.org">copyright@asme.org</a>.</p>
