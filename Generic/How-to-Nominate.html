    <p><strong>The Basic Importance of ASME Honors </strong>
        Recognition of outstanding achievement in engineering is one of the major objectives of ASME which it seeks to
        attain through its programs of honors and awards. Such programs provide necessary and desirable recognition for
        outstanding contributions to the art and science of engineering. They give opportunity for personalized
        presentations to honor recipients which dramatize to the public the achievements of the engineering profession.
        They provide inspiring examples to all engineers, and they identify ASME with excellence in engineering.</p>
    <p>The Society honors and awards fall into two main categories, those for achievement and those for contributions to
        engineering literature. Achievement awards may in turn be grouped into those available to all in the profession
        and those restricted to some special field within the profession. Similarly, literature awards may be considered
        in two groups, those available to all in the profession and those restricted to a specialized field. </p>
    <p>Several ASME honors and awards have been conferred for more than half a century. These include the achievement
        awards of Honorary Membership (1880), the Charles T. Main Award (1919), the ASME Medal (1920), and the Holley
        Medal (1924). The oldest literature awards are the Henry Hess Award (1914), the Melville Medal (1927), and the
        Worcester Reed Warner Medal (1930). Since 1930, sixty-two additional awards have been established. </p>
    <p><strong>Who May Nominate? </strong>
        Any individual Member or committee may nominate candidates for any Society honor and award or for any Joint
        Award as listed in the Honors Manual, except individual voting members of the Board of Governors, Committee on
        Honors, General Awards Committee, and other committees which sit in judgment on the nominations unless it is the
        committee's responsibility to develop honors material. A nomination by a non-member is referred to the proper
        ASME body for action.</p>
    <p><strong>The Importance of the Nomination in Form and Content</strong>
        Each recipient of an honor or award must be an eminently worthy candidate. It is therefore the duty and
        responsibility of each Member to bring forward outstanding candidates of whose work and accomplishments he or
        she has personal knowledge. It is a serious mistake to assume that "they" - meaning the honor or award
        committees or the ASME leadership in general - "know all about the nominee." The enormous scope of ASME
        activities and its large membership make it essential that award selection boards be provided the necessary
        complete information for judging the nominations. Thus the judges must have thorough and well-prepared
        NOMINATIONS. Remember also that "they" may be, in most cases, ineligible to make NOMINATIONS or sponsor
        candidates for honors and awards. </p>
    <p><strong>How to Nominate </strong>
        The first step in making a NOMINATION for a particular honor is to become completely familiar with the
        requirements to be met by the candidate for the honor, as given in the <a title="List of all Society Awards"
            href="/about-asme/participate/honors-awards/award-information/list-of-society-awards">List of all Society
            Awards</a>. Comparison of the accomplishments of the candidate with the accomplishments of previous
        recipients of the honors will help the nominator in deciding whether to make a NOMINATION. </p>
    <p>The Achievement Form &amp; Instructions and Literature Form &amp; Instructions contain detailed instructions and
        suggestions for preparing a NOMINATION. Using the instructions in combination with the appropriate nomination
        form (see Resources at the end of this section), the nominator should study and follow these carefully so that
        the relevant accomplishments of the candidate will be properly presented. The suggested format stresses the
        importance of a clear, precise narrative and description of the accomplishments of the candidate, and of a
        complete listing of both the ASME activities and the honors he or she has been awarded. </p>

    <p><strong>Early Career Awards </strong>

        An Early Career award evaluates achievement from the start of the professional career, which is typically after
        a relevant terminal degree: BS or MS for industry and PhD for academia. A criterion based upon time-from-degree
        is usually specified. This removes any constraints due to the age of the individual. It can accommodate career
        delays due to military service, child bearing/raising, etc. However, career interruptions due to non-traditional
        career paths, post-doctoral work and second careers continue to pose challenges when applying this criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>Young Investigator/Engineer Awards</strong>

        A Young Investigator/Engineer Award has an age-based criterion. This criterion is very specific and easily
        applied. The history of science and technology is full of examples where famous and accomplished scientists and
        engineers exhibited their talents at younger ages. So it is desirable to have in place a system to recognize and
        reward early achievements as a young individual. Another potential benefit is that early recognition may
        motivate talented individuals to stay in their chosen field of specialization.</p>
    <p>The flip side is that many individuals are taking non-traditional career paths, or have their professional
        careers delayed due to military service, child bearing/raising, career changes, etc. Some may embark on a second
        career due to changes in interest or in technology. The talents and achievements of this group are not
        recognized by the Young Investigator/Engineer award system.</p>

    <p><strong>Who Selects ASME Honors Recipients?</strong>
        The ASME Committee on Honors nominates the candidates for Honorary Membership and the ASME Medal to the Board of
        Governors. The Board of Governors, by unanimous vote, selects recipients of Honorary Membership and the ASME
        Medal. </p>
    <p>By direct delegation of the authority of the Board of Governors, the ASME Committee on Honors selects the
        recipients of all other ASME honors and awards. </p>
    <p>For general achievement and literature awards, the General Awards Committee nominates the candidates to the ASME
        Committee on Honors for selection. For each special award, the relevant award committee nominates candidates to
        the ASME Committee on Honors for selection. In general the Committee on Honors has the right of veto or of
        choice but not the right of substitution for candidates who have been nominated by the General Awards Committee
        or Special Award Committees.</p>
