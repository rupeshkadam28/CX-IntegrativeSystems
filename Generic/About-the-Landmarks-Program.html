                      <p>Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks are existing artifacts or systems representing a
                          significant mechanical engineering technology. They generally are the oldest extant, last
                          surviving examples typical of a period, or they are machines with some unusual distinction.
                      </p>
                      <p>Landmarks, sites and collections of historic importance to mechanical engineering are
                          designated by ASME through its History and Heritage Landmarks Program. Landmark status
                          indicates that the artifact, site or collection represents a <em>significant</em> step
                          forward in the evolution of mechanical engineering and is the <em>best known</em> example of
                          its kind. A plaque is presented for display, a commemorative brochure is prepared, and a
                          roster is kept to promote long-term recognition and preservation efforts.</p>
                      <p>The breadth of our mechanical engineering heritage is evident in the landmarks program.
                          Nearly 250 landmarks have been designated since the program began in 1971.The landmarks
                          programalso includes:</p>
                      <ul class="primary-list">
                          <li>Mechanical Engineering Heritage Sites, orparticular locales at which some event or
                              development occurred or which some machine, building, or complex of significance
                              occupied.</li>
                          <li>Mechanical Engineering Heritage Collections,whichrefers to a museum or collection that
                              includes related objects of special significance to, but not necessarily a major
                              evolutionary step in, the historical development of mechanical engineering.</li>

                          <li>To foster the preservation of the physical remains of historically important engineering
                              works</li>
                          <li>To encourage mechanical engineers and others to become aware of their technological
                              heritage</li>
                          <li>To inform the public of such contributions</li>
                          <li>To provide an annotated roster of landmarks,sites, and collections in mechanical
                              engineering for engineers, students,educators, historians, scholars, and travelers</li>
                          <li>To promote these achievements in materials for use by the public</li>
                          <li>To call attention to the noteworthy mechanical engineers who were associated with the
                              invention, development, or production of these singular technological achievements.</li>
