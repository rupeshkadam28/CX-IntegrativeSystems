<p>Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks are existing artifacts or systems representing a
    significant mechanical engineering technology. They generally are the oldest extant, last
    surviving examples typical of a period, or they are machines with some unusual distinction.
</p>
<p>Landmarks, sites and collections of historic importance to mechanical engineering are
    designated by ASME through its History and Heritage Landmarks Program. Landmark status
    indicates that the artifact, site or collection represents a <em>significant</em> step
    forward in the evolution of mechanical engineering and is the <em>best known</em> example of
    its kind. A plaque is presented for display, a commemorative brochure is prepared, and a
    roster is kept to promote long-term recognition and preservation efforts.</p>
<p>The breadth of our mechanical engineering heritage is evident in the landmarks program.
    Nearly 250 landmarks have been designated since the program began in 1971.The landmarks
    programalso includes:</p>
<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>Mechanical Engineering Heritage Sites, orparticular locales at which some event or
        development occurred or which some machine, building, or complex of significance
        occupied.</li>
    <li>Mechanical Engineering Heritage Collections,whichrefers to a museum or collection that
        includes related objects of special significance to, but not necessarily a major
        evolutionary step in, the historical development of mechanical engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The History and Heritage Landmarks program intends:</h3>
<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>To foster the preservation of the physical remains of historically important engineering
        works</li>
    <li>To encourage mechanical engineers and others to become aware of their technological
        heritage</li>
    <li>To inform the public of such contributions</li>
    <li>To provide an annotated roster of landmarks,sites, and collections in mechanical
        engineering for engineers, students,educators, historians, scholars, and travelers</li>
    <li>To promote these achievements in materials for use by the public</li>
    <li>To call attention to the noteworthy mechanical engineers who were associated with the
        invention, development, or production of these singular technological achievements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section will serve as a guideto the process and protocols of nominating and designating
    landmarks. Everything you need to nominate a landmark, heritage site or heritage collection
    can be found online. Move through the landmark guidelines and criteria (located in the links
    on the left of the page), thenpreview the nomination form under &quot;nominating a
    landmark.&quot;</p>

<h3>Deadlines</h3>
<p>The cycle for ASME History and Heritage activities is fairly regular:</p>
<p>To ensure review of Landmark and Engineer-Historian Award nominations at the June Annual
    Meeting please submit them by<strong>April 1.</strong> However, a nomination can be
    submitted at any time of year.</p>
