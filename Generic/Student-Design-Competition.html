<p>The ASME Student Design Competition provides a platform for ASME Student Members to present their solutions to a
	range of design problems - from everyday household tasks to groundbreaking space exploration. Each team is
	required to design, construct and operate a prototype meeting the requirements of an annually determined problem
	statement.</p>
<p>Student Design Competitions will be held at ASME&rsquo;s global E-Fests (Engineering Festivals). E-Fests are a
	three-day, two-night regional event built around design, advanced manufacturing and robotics technologies. They
	enable engineering students to expand their knowledge, test and showcase new skills and inspire innovation.</p>
<p>To participate in the Student Design Competition teams must register in advance through the respective E-Fest
	regional website.</p>
