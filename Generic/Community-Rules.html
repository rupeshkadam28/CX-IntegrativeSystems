                        <p>The addition of social networking capabilities to ASME.org (the "Site") provides registered
                            ASME participants who participate in various ASME groups ("ASME.org Participants" or "Group
                            Participants") with the ability to share commentary, messages, information, documents,
                            images, questions, links and other material. ASME believes that these social networking
                            capabilities will facilitate knowledge-sharing within the engineering community, thereby
                            furthering ASME's mission to serve diverse global communities by advancing, disseminating
                            and applying engineering knowledge for improving the quality of life, and by communicating
                            the excitement of engineering.</p>

                        <p>This is an online community for thoughtful and courteous debate and discussion. ASME's goal
                            is to encourage and stimulate community communications and collaboration. Participants
                            should therefore keep in mind that in this professional community, professional behavior is

                            others will not be permitted. </p>
