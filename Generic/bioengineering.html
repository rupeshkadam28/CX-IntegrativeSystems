                      <p><strong>CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
                      <p>Since 1973, ASME has sponsored the Congressional Fellowship program to provide an opportunity
                          for
                          Society members to work with the U.S. Congress. As federal legislation becomes increasingly
                          technical, the need for engineering expertise is essential. Congressional fellows participate
                          directly in the lawmaking process and learn how the federal government operates. In addition,
                          Congress is provided with the necessary engineering expertise and, at the end of the
                          fellowship
                          year, a fellow's employer has an engineer with in-depth knowledge of congressional
                          decision-making processes. </p>
                      <p>Once chosen as a congressional fellow, an ASME member selects his or her congressional
                          assignment
                          through interviews with congressional offices, with assistance from the ASME government
                          relations staff, and with reference to the issues identified in the Public Policy Agenda of
                          ASME.</p>
                      <p><strong>Applicant Background</strong><br>

                          Applicants for this Fellowship must have a strong bioengineering background. Bioengineering is
                          an interdisciplinary field that applies physical, chemical, and mathematical sciences, and
                          engineering principles to the study of biology, medicine, behavior, and health. It advances
                          knowledge from the molecular to the organ levels, and develops new and novel biologically
                          derived medications and devices, materials processes, implants, and informatics approaches for
                          the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for
                          improving health. Bioengineers have employed mechanical engineering principles in the
                          development of many life-saving and life-improving technologies, such as the artificial heart,
                          prosthetic joints, diagnostics, and numerous rehabilitation technologies. In addition, new
                          emerging areas such as nanotechnology and biomanufacturing, require significant contributions
                          from bioengineers. While total health-related US research and development investments have
                          expanded significantly over the last decade, investment in bioengineering at NIH institutes
                          like
                          the NIBIB has remained relatively flat over the last several years; when in many instances,
                          bioengineering-based solutions to health care problems can result in improved health outcomes
                          and reductions in health care costs. ASME has long been concerned about the level of
                          bioengineering investments and the need to increase bioengineering expertise within the NIBIB
                          and across NIH and the federal government, including Congress.</p>

                      <p><strong>Recruitment and Training</strong><br>

                          Fellows may serve from January through December, or September through August, at their option.
                          An ASME selection committee screens applications and will notify selected candidates of their
                          interest in scheduling an interview in February or March. Interviews with final candidates
                          will
                          be scheduled in April. After the interviews, the selection committee may tentatively match
                          finalists with available fellowship opportunities. Selected fellows will receive offers in
                          late
                          April or early May.</p>
                      <p>Fellows are required to attend a two-week orientation course in Washington, DC, in September.
                          Administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the course
                          provides useful training and a foundation for a fellow's network that serves as both a formal
                          and informal resource for participants throughout the fellowship year.</p>
                      <p><strong>Financial Support of Federal Government Fellows</strong><br>

                          ASME has a limited number of stipends of $80,000 per congressional/federal government fellow.
                          Because the stipend is not intended to be the fellow's entire financial support, the remaining
                          salary and other costs, including benefits, must be negotiated between the fellow and his or
                          her
                          employer. Society members selected for congressional fellowships typically take a one-year
                          leave
                          of absence from their employer.</p>
