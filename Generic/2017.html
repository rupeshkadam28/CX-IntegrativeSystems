				<p>Throughout his 61-year engineering career John has been an inventor and problem solver. He
					has over 400 invention disclosures and 33 patents. Early inventions were primarily for
					defense industry programs like the F-16, AWACS, and B-1B. </p>
				In 1981, John founded VME (Volunteers for Medical Engineering) solving problems faced by persons
				living with disabilities. VME grew and merged with Learning Independence Through Computers
				(LINC), which was involved with similar efforts, to become V-LINC. He and his coworkers created
				new antenna developments by day and assistive devices in the evenings and weekends. Through his
				example and the promotion of VME, he encouraged thousands of engineers, college and high school
				students and friends to create solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals living
				with a disability. </p>


				<p>John takes great pleasure in watching someone use their hand for the first time (using VME’s
					Servo-driven Orthosis), or in hearing someone in an iron lung exclaim “oh boy!” with the
					blink of his eye (using VME’s blink Writer System), or looking a person straight in the eye
					as they abandon their wheelchair to cruise around in VME’s Mobile Standing Frame. The Future
					Home, in Jarrettsville, Maryland created in part by VME volunteers was state-of-the-art 30
					years ago. It is still operational today. It features wheelchair presence-sensing elements
					at the front entrance’s automatic doors, surveillance cameras, and drop-down kitchen
					shelving, which is now considered standard to “Universal Design.”
					John remains active with V-LINC and his local community. He knows that creative
					possibilities are endless and he continues to work on the special solutions made possible by
					the volunteer-supported initiatives at V-LINC: bike clinics, summer camp, high school
					projects, community college and engineering projects, all of which improve the quality of
					life for persons living with disabilities. </p>

				<p>John is presently living at the Carroll Lutheran Village (CLV) retirement community where he
					is designing a “Lever Drive Bicycle” giving persons living with disabilities the ability to
					ride a bicycle, and an “Opposing Door Opener” that allows someone in a mobility vehicle to
					enter a home with doors wide open for unimpeded access. He chairs regular meetings of local
					volunteers to inspire creation of solutions to obstacles faced by their fellow seniors at
					CLV and for disabled children with V-LINC volunteers.</p>

				<p>He earned his BSME from Johns Hopkins University in 1961 and his MSME from the University of
					Maryland in 1965. John is a licensed professional engineer.</p>

				<p>If you ask John when he plans to retire, he will say, “When they close the casket. Actually,
					I’m donating my body to science, so not even then.”</p>
