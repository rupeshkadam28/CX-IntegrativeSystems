                            An individual in a lead role submits our Group Membership Participation Request Form, and an

                                does ASME Group Membership cost?</span>

                            Group Membership rates are based on the current professional member dues &ndash; with these
                            special Group discounts: 25&#37; off the first year for new members and 10&#37; off for
                            renewing members. (Example: $158 US current professional dues x 10 joiners &#61; $1,580 less
                            25&#37; the first year new members &ndash; a savings of $395!)
