				<p>On December 13, 2016, a Congressional Briefing on &ldquo;Advanced
					Robotics in Manufacturing&rdquo; was held in the Senate.
					Moderating the panel was Chuck Thorpe, Senior Vice President and
					Provost of Clarkson University and Co-Chair of the ASME Robotics
					Public Policy Task Force. </p>

				<p>The four panelists included:</p>

				<ul class="primary-list">
					<li>Howie Choset, Carnegie Mellon University, Professor of
						Robotics; Medrobotics, Inc., Co-Founder</li>
					<li>Larry Sweet, Georgia Institute of Technology, IRIM Associate
						Director of Technology Transition and Professor of the
						Practice in Robotics</li>
					<li>Erik Nieves, PlusOne Robotics, Founder and CEO</li>
					<li>Michael Dudzik, IQM, President</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The briefing began with opening remarks delivered by Senator Chris
					Coons, a Co-Chair of the Senate Competitiveness Caucus. Senator
					Coons posed a few questions to the panelists to encourage
					discussion around how we can rise above the challenges facing
					the industry today, such as: What does the future of employment
					in the manufacturing industry look like and what does robotics
					in manufacturing mean for manufacturing jobs? How do we deal
					with cyber security as more elements of our manufacturing
					infrastructure rely on robotics? And how do we help small and
					medium-sized companies succeed with, and adapt to, new
					technologies? The Senator announced that he believes we have
					reason for optimism moving forward, citing the Manufacturing USA
					and Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEP) initiatives as
					opportunities for increased success in the coming year.</p>

				<p>Moderator Chuck Thorpe formally set the stage, informing the audience
					as to how robots are changing the manufacturing environment. He
					mentioned that we used to think of the words dangerous, dull,
					and disappearing when we thought of manufacturing. Now, however,
					we think of three new Ds: (1) Dexterous: Robots can reach places
					and perform tasks that humans simply cannot or should not. For
					instance, robots today can reach into the ribs of an airplane
					wing, as well as the ribs of a cardiac patient. (2) Deeply
					integrated: Today, robotic technologies are built into the
					systems themselves. Smart systems don&rsquo;t look like robots,
					they look like cars and cranes and other things, which the
					robotics are simply integrated into. (3) Disappearing…I
					Don&rsquo;t Think So: New robotic technologies are encouraging
					new skills and jobs to arise. Thorpe ended with the idea that
					for further advancement, robotics needs mechanical engineering,
					and mechanical engineers need robotics, a connection that is
					often overlooked.</p>

				<p>The first panelist to present was Howie Choset, who spoke to the
					relationship between robotics and jobs. He has a background in
					working with &ldquo;snake robots&rdquo; – highly flexible
					systems to go into very small places. Howie believes that
					flexibility, both in the robot structures and their skill, is
					the key to advancing the industry. Robotic systems are expensive
					and 98.5% of manufacturers in the U.S. are small- or
					medium-sized manufacturers who do not have the capital to invest
					in technology that cannot adapt to future changes. Howie also
					mentioned that paired with this idea of flexible robots is the
					need for flexible job training. Panelist Larry Sweet agreed with
					this point, and then spoke about the increased need for
					collaborative robotics.</p>

				<p>Larry has observed that many manufacturers see the opportunity to
					grow if automation becomes more flexible. The key, he notes, is
					to balance the risk of adopting new technologies with
					opportunity which can be achieved through making systems more
					flexible for increased productivity. Collaborative robots,
					flexible robots, and mobile robots are all new types of
					technologies that will inject flexibility into the system,
					prompting innovation and increased productivity. Today, robots
					and humans are co-habiting manufacturing floors, but working
					separately. In order to advance, humans and robots, Larry
					suggests the need for the two to work together so that they can
					each preform the tasks the other cannot at the same time, on the
					same product.</p>

				<p>Erik Nieves, an Industrial Robotics Engineer, spoke further about the
					impact of robotics on the small manufacturer. Most manufacturing
					that employs robots today is low-mix, high-volume production,
					meaning building the same thing over and over. Robots are
					extremely good at repetitive tasks, but they need to become
					better at doing high-mix, low-volume production. Erik noted that
					three-fourths of our industrial base is 20 employees or less,
					meaning the main place for growth in robotic manufacturing is
					with small companies.</p>
