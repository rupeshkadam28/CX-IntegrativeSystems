                <p><strong>ASME Standards &amp; Certification Activities</strong></p>

                <p>For more than 125 years, industries worldwide have depended on ASME for technically sound,
                    issue-precise standards. In turn, participation by volunteers in the standards development
                    process, supported by their employers, has been a bedrock of ASME Standards &amp;
                    Certification.</p>
