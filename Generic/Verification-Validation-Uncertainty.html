<h3>&ldquo;Do you know how much V&amp;V is necessary to support using your computational Model?&rdquo;
</h3>
<p> To help improve the efficacy and streamline costs throughout the pre-market and post-market stages
	of a
	product's life cycle, manufacturers are shifting away from physical testing toward computational
	(predictive)
	modeling techniques and performance simulations (CM&amp;S). </p>
<p> As a result, engineers, scientists, and program developers are now often tasked with developing and
	analyzing
	computational models and simulations when designing or improving a product or a system. </p>
<p> Performing computational modeling and simulation can decrease the number of physical tests necessary
	for product
	development. Assuring that the computational model has been formed using sound procedures is key and
	is achieved
	through the processes of verification, validation and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). </p>
<p> Verification is performed to determine if the computational model fits the mathematical description.
	Validation
	is implemented to determine if the model accurately represents the real world application.
	Uncertainty
	quantification is conducted to determine how variations in the numerical and physical parameters
	affect
	simulation outcomes. </p>

<h3>V&amp;V Symposium Resources</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Challenge Problems</strong>
	The V&amp;V 20 and V&amp;V 30 Subcommittees hold a series of Challenge and Workshop Problem sessions
	at the
	V&amp;V Symposium.
</p>
<p> Challenge problems are specific engineering application problems designed to study and assess
	Verification,
	Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) methods in modeling and simulation. Challenge
	problems are
	designed to provide insight into VVUQ approaches and a comparison of their performance for a
	specific problem by
	experts in the field. A problem statement and detailed information required to perform the analysis
	is made
	available to all participants. A technical meeting is held to share the results obtained from the
	participants.
	A summary for the suite of results and key insights are collected and documented.
