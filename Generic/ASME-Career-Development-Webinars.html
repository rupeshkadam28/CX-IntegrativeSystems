<p><strong>ASME has partnered with the Engineering Management Institute (EMI) to bring you a
        series of Career Development Webinars custom-made for Mechanical Engineers. ASME is
        proud to announce this new valuable members-only benefit!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Engineering projects don&rsquo;t just happen because engineers are technically
        proficient. They happen also because…</strong></p>


<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>an engineer who was able to <strong>speak effectively</strong> was able to sell the
        project to a municipality or a private client, or</li>
    <li>an engineer who could <strong>communicate well</strong> saved the project in its early
        stages by working with several parties to overcome challenges, or</li>
    <li>an engineer <strong>effectively led</strong> a team to turn an idea into reality.</li>

</ul>
<p>
    These are all <strong>engineering management skills</strong>, but they are harder to come by
    than you may think.
</p>

<p>
    The EMI serves to help engineers become more effective managers and leaders through content,
    coaching, and training. Anthony Fasano, PE is the founder of the EMI and will be presenting
    these Career Development Webinars.
