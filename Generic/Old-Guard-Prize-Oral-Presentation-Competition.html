<h3>Section A &#61 Description of the Competition</h3>
<p> Like all professionals, engineers must possess a well-developed ability to synthesize issues and
	communicate effectively to diverse audiences. Among the highlights of the ASME E-Fest (Engineering
	Festival) is the <strong>Old Guard Oral Presentation Competition</strong>. This competition is
	designed to emphasize the value of an ability to deliver clear, concise and effective oral
	presentations, particularly pertaining to some sphere in which an engineer is or should be involved.
	The Old Guard Committee offers significant prize money to competition winners. </p>
<p> Each student presentation lasts fifteen minutes and is followed by a five minute &ldquo;Question and
	Answer&rdquo; (Q&amp;A) period. First Place finalists from each E-Fest event are invited to compete
	at the Society level competition at the International Mechanical Engineering Congress &amp;
	Exposition (IMECE) held during November. </p>
<p> Note: While these rules primarily address the ASME E-Fest, they may be utilized by any ASME group
	(Section, Student Section, Division, or EFx host) wishing to conduct an oral competition. Although
	the Old Guard will not provide prize monies nor invitations to IMECE for winners at these events,
	appropriate reference to the ASME Old Guard will be appreciated. </p>

<h3>Section B &#61 Information for Student Entries</h3>
<p> <span>ADVANCE Registration is required in order to guarantee a presentation slot during the E-Fest
		sessions. On-site registrations will be handled at the discretion of the host and Old Guard
		committee on “as-available” basis. Due to timing constraints and facility planning, advanced
		registration is highly encouraged.</span> </p>
<h3>B-1 Eligibility and Requirements</h3>
<p> To be eligible to participate at an E-Fest Competition, each contestant must be a Student Member
	who:

	<ol type="a">
		<li>has not yet received an engineering degree* and, </li>
		<li>has been selected by his/her Student Section or ME Department to participate; and, </li>
		<li>is a Student Member in good standing.
	</ol>
	* Student Members who complete the requirements for their baccalaureate engineering degree, or who
	actually receive that degree at the end of a term, semester, or quarter a short time before a
	scheduled conference may still participate. These Student Members, however, must not have completed
	their degree requirements before December 1 of the calendar year prior to the Conference.
</p>
<h3>B-2 The Presentation</h3>
<p> Each student presentation lasts fifteen minutes and is followed by a five minute &ldquo;Question and
	Answer&rdquo; (Q&amp;A) period. Significant prize money is offered at each E-Fest and at the IMECE
	final competition as detailed in Sections D and E. </p>
<p> Each presentation in the Oral Presentation Competition must be delivered in English. The subject
	matter of each presentation must address a technical, economic or environmental aspect of
	engineering or other basic engineering theme, provided it pertains to some sphere in which an
	engineer is or should be involved. A major portion of a contestant&rsquo;s total score is based on
	the judges&rsquo; evaluation of his/her relative capability to communicate orally, including
	evidence of a talent to respond effectively during the Q&amp;A period. </p>
<p> A competitor may utilize any available resource but must realize that the presentation is to be an
	individual effort. Assistance in the use of visual aids is advisable (PowerPoint, models, etc.).
	Film clips, if used, may not exceed one-minute total duration (i.e. a maximum of one minute of each
	student presentation may be used for video). Film clips may not be accompanied by any recorded
	sound, although explanations may be provided by the presenter as the video is being played. Good
	practice and courtesy suggest credit be given during the presentation for any outside help related
	to the reported project. A written paper or manuscript is not required. </p>
<p> <span>Students planning to compete are encouraged to review the JUDGING instructions detailed below
		in <a href="#C">Section C &ndash; Information for E-Fest Hosts and Judges</a>. </span> </p>

<p><strong> Students entering the Old Guard Oral Competition may not also enter the Old Guard Technical
		Poster Competition. </strong></p>
<h3>B-4 Conduct of the Contest</h3>
<p> Each presentation in the Old Guard Competition shall be made by one contestant. Any questions
	regarding procedure shall be resolved by the E-Fest host Student Section Advisor and ASME staff or
	the Old Guard Committee before the Conference.
	The Chair of the Host Student Section usually presides during the contest and ensures that there is
	adherence to the time schedule given in the printed program. The Presentation duration is fifteen
	(15) minutes plus five (5) minutes for Q&amp;A immediately thereafter. Any time remaining or
	exceeding the fifteen minutes must be added to or subtracted from the five-minute Q&amp;A
	discussion. <em>A five-minute transition time between presentations is recommended.</em> </p>
<p> No photographs may be taken during the presentation; photographs may be taken during the question
	and answer period.</p>
<p> Questions may be asked by any attendee of the competition except those from the competitor&rsquo;s
	own educational institution. Each person posing a question to a speaker must stand, identify
	himself/herself and school, and then proceed with the question. At the end of twelve minutes, the
	timekeeper will signal to the speaker that there are three minutes remaining.</p>

<p>At the end of fourteen minutes, the timekeeper will signal to the speaker that there is
	one-minute remaining. </p>
<p>At the end of fifteen minutes, timekeeper will signal for the speaker to conclude the
	presentation. </p>
<p>The timekeeper will signal at the end of five minutes to terminate the discussion period. The
	speaker should promptly complete response to the current question and close their presentation.
</p>

<h3>B-5 Content</h3>
<p> To what extent is the subject of interest to a technical audience? Is credit given for source of
	material or contribution by others? How much knowledge of subject was exhibited? Is work independent
	and original? Is the subject technical or general in nature? </p>
<h3>B-6 Organization</h3>
<p> Is there any novel approach to the subject? Is there sufficient background information provided in
	order to introduce the audience to the subject? Are the facts developed in logical and continuous
	sequence? Is there a definite conclusion, and was it adequately based on the facts or data
	presented? </p>
<h3>B-7 Delivery and Effectiveness</h3>
<p> Are the words distinctly pronounced with a speed appropriate for the cultural makeup of the audience
	and judges and was proper volume used to be heard by all? Is proper English used, and is the
	vocabulary sufficient? Is personal appearance appropriate? Are there any distracting mannerisms? Is
	the manner of delivery (conversation, memorized, read from manuscript) satisfactory? If visual aids
	are used, how effectively are they used? Is the presentation within the time limit of 15 minutes
	allowed? </p>
<h3>B-8 Discussion</h3>
<p> Is the presentation evoking spontaneous questions from the audience? Are the questions indicating
	the need for clarification of facts presented, or were they merely of the type seeking additional
	information? How readily and with what self-assurance did the speaker answer the questions? Are the
	answers indicating knowledge of the subject beyond that disclosed in the original presentation? Is
	the ability to think clearly demonstrated? </p>

	positioned to be able to clearly view the speaker, podium and projector screen. </p>
<h3>C-3 Judging and Scoring Criteria</h3>
<p> Each competition session is to be judged by the same Judging Team throughout, preferably three
	judges, but a minimum of two ASME members of mature judgment, who are selected along with one or two
	alternates. Local ASME Senior Sections should be requested to cooperate in the search for judges.
	Each E-Fest host shall select the judging team and timekeeper.
	<p> The Presentations will be judged in four categories; Content, Organization, Delivery and
		Effectiveness, and Discussion. See hotlink below for the Judging Sheet to be used. </p>
	<p> Judges are to use the Scoring Sheet provided: (<a
			href="http://cdn.asme.orghttp://cdn.asme.org/media/ResourceFiles/Events/Competitions/Old-Guard-Oral-Contest-Scoring-Sheet.pdf"
			target="_blank">Download Judging Sheet</a>)
		as the basis for judging all the E-Fest Conferences. The Scoring Sheet has been developed for
		the convenience of the judges in evaluating the presentation in competition. Scoring Sheet
		samples should be sent to the judges for familiarity ahead of the contest. Completed Scoring
		Sheets are <strong>not to be given</strong> to the presenters. Judges should be informed that
		they must agree to serve through the entire contest, be it one or two days. </p>
	<p> Judges are encouraged to fill out the Feedback Sheet: (<a
			href="http://cdn.asme.org/media/ResourceFiles/Events/Competitions/Old-Guard-Oral-Contest-Feedback-Sheet.pdf"
			target="_blank">Download Feedback Sheet</a>) on each student&rsquo;s presentation and give
		them to the contestants at the conclusion of the presentations. The Feedback Sheet has been
		developed for the convenience of the judge to assist him/her in this process. </p>
	<p> Sufficient copies of the judging worksheets and feedback sheets shall be provided by the host at
		the beginning of each presentation session. </p>
	<p> Highly recommended is a private judges briefing prior to the first presentation to assure that
		the team will score the presentations equally. </p>
