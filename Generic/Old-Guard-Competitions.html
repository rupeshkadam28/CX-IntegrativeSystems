                <h3>The Old Guard Program Competitions</h3>
                <p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce that some of the Old Guard Competitions will now be taking
                    place at ASME&rsquo;s global <a href="http://efests.asme.org/">E-Fests</a> (Engineering
                    Festivals). E-Fests are three-day, two-night regional events built around design, advanced
                    manufacturing and robotics technologies. They enable engineering students to expand their
                    knowledge, test and showcase new skills and inspire innovation.</p>
                <p><strong>You must register online for the Old Guard Competitions through the
                        regional</strong> <a href="http://efests.asme.org/"><strong>E-Fest website</strong></a>
