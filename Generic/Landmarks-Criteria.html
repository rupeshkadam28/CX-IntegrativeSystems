                        <p>The following questions offer a guide to the criteria for approval of a landmark nomination
                            by ASME's History and Heritage Committee. (Nominators please note that in preparing a
                            nomination, you must conform to the enumeration on the form NOT the criteria list.) To
                            review the criteria, click on each item for a fuller explanation provided below.</p>
                        <h3>Criteria Explained</h3>
                        <p><strong>Is the work an example of mechanical engineering?</strong></p>
                        <p>The work must be an example of mechanical engineering, and the nomination must clearly
                            identify the mechanical engineering content that is being nominated. When the work is a
                            mechanical engineering artifact such as a machine or engine this may be obvious, but often
                            the mechanical engineering content will be part of a larger entity. In such cases, the
                            mechanical engineering work must be clearly identified in the nomination and, if designated,
                            will be part of the entity that is so recognized.</p>
                        <p><strong>Is the work:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li><strong>An artifact(s) that was (or could have been) conceived, designed, developed, or
                                    constructed by a mechanical engineer(s)?</strong> Examples are an engine, a machine,
                                a mechanism, a major mechanical feature of a larger work, without which the larger work
                                would not be recognizable and could not perform its intended function (e.g., the engines
                                of a ship), a pressure vessel.The work need not have been conceived, designed,
                                developed, or constructed by a person who meets the contemporary definition of a
                                mechanical engineer, but the work itself must be a mechanical engineering work. In other
                                words, the work must be something that an ASME member might have invented, designed,
                                developed, or constructed.

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>A body of knowledge, analytical tool or code of practice developed or produced
                                    primarily by a mechanical engineer(s) for use primarily by mechanical
                                    engineers?</strong> Examples are the ASME Boiler Code, steam tables, a computer
                                program for predicting the kinematics of mechanisms. The Committee believes that
                                recognition of the development of the tools of the mechanical engineering profession is
                                important, because it makes mechanical engineers aware of their technological heritage.
                                Note, however, that the Committee places high weight on the landmark being a tangible,
                                physical entity, and this may be difficult to identify in the area of tools and
                                practice. But an early ASME Boiler Code book has been landmarked, so there is
                                opportunity.

                            </li>
                            <li><strong>A place of historic significance to the practice and profession of mechanical
                                    engineering.
                                </strong> Examples are: a place of mechanical engineering invention or discovery, a
                                laboratory where significant mechanical engineering data were developed, a factory where
                                significant mechanical technology was employed, a place where a famous engineer lived or
                                practiced. The Committee believes that we need to recognize the significant heroes and
                                locales of our profession, so that we show the human face of mechanical engineering.
                                Sites have been and may be nominated as landmarks, but must be of major significance to
                                be accepted. The reason is that a site is less tangible evidence of mechanical
                                engineering than an actual artifact, and so must be relatively more significant to
                                satisfy the choice of one site more than another.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Does the work represent a significant step in the history of mechanical
                                engineering?</strong>

                            Much mechanical engineering is evolutionary, where one work builds on the technology by a
                            prior work. What the Committee looks for here are such steps as the breakthrough idea, the
                            unique concept, the first use of a synergy of technologies, the quantum leap in size,
                            performance, efficiency, and so on. The nomination must identify why the work has special
                            mechanical engineering significance.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Did the work make a contribution to the development of humanity in general
                                    and the profession and/or practice of mechanical engineering in particular?
                                </strong>Most mechanical engineering work has made a positive contribution to
                            the world in which we live. The nomination must show the contribution of the work to
                            humanity and/or mechanical engineering; if there is little or none there is no justification
                            for the landmark recognition.



                            A military work (e.g., weaponry) will be considered, but only in the strict context of its
                            contribution to the advancement of mechanical engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What makes this proposed work unique or distinctive? Why should this work be the
                                designated work?</strong>

                            There are frequently several examples of the work that still exist. In such cases, the
                            landmark nomination needs to identify the other examples and clearly justify why this
                            specific work should receive the recognition.



                            In a case where there is more than one known example of the work, the Committee judges
                            whether the nominated work is the one to be designated. Many factors are weighed, but the
                            following preferences are among those that are used to select one example over the other:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li>the older will be preferred over the newer</li>
                            <li>the intact over the partial</li>
                            <li>the original over a replica or restoration</li>
                            <li>the tangible example over the more abstract</li>
                            <li>the one more representative of the operational state (but not necessarily operational)
                                over the lesser</li>
                            <li>the accessible over the inaccessible</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note particularly that if one example has already been recognized as an ASME Historic
                            Mechanical Engineering Landmark, the Committee will not accept a second example as a
                            landmark &mdash; even if it meets the preferences above &mdash; unless the nomination gives
                            compelling reasons why it should do so. Note also that the fact that the other example is in
                            a different geographic area is not a compelling reason.</p>
                        <p>The Committee is more interested in recognizing mechanical engineering work that has not
                            received prior historical recognition, since this gives the owner of the unrecognized work
                            an awareness of its historical worth and may increase the likelihood that work will be
                            preserved.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Will designating this as a historic mechanical engineering work:</strong>

                                <strong>a) Enhance the public's understanding of the role of mechanical engineers in
                                    society, and/or

                                    b) Celebrate and enhance the profession of mechanical engineering in general, and
                                    ASME in particular?
                                </strong>Major aims of the Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks Program
                            are to inform the public of the contribution of mechanical engineers to society and to make
                            mechanical engineers more aware of their heritage. The work will be judged on how well it
                            meets these goals. Landmarked works should make members of ASME proud that mechanical
                            engineering was involved.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Has sufficient time elapsed to make an objective judgment that the work has
                                    lasting value?
                            </strong>The Committee needs to be sure that the work is significant and of lasting value to
                            the profession of mechanical engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Is this work accessible to mechanical engineers, historians, and/or the
                                    public?</strong>

                            To have impact and raise awareness of the achievements of mechanical engineering, a
                            landmarked work must be accessible to as many people as possible. The Committee puts weight
                            on the tangibility, visibility, and accessibility of landmarks. A place where there is now
                            little or no evidence of a work will probably not be recognized.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Has this work already been recognized for historic mechanical engineering
                                    significance by another professional engineering society or historical organization?
                                    Would ASME's designation add important value to the existing
                                    recognition?</strong>

                            The Committee acknowledges that there are other engineering societies, for example SAE and
                            ASHRAE, and a number of historical organizations that recognize work for its historical
                            mechanical content. If the work already has been so recognized, the Committee will not
                            consider ASME designation unless it is for significant, unrecognized historic mechanical
                            engineering content, or if there is some compelling reason why ASME's designation would add
                            important value to the existing recognition.</p>
                        <p>Note in particular that a mechanical engineering work in a museum containing other mechanical
                            engineering works must be extremely significant to be singled out for designation. Also some
                            museums may not permit a specific work to be identified by an ASME plaque, and this needs to
                            be checked out before the nomination is submitted and/or the designation made.</p>
                        <p>If the work has not been recognized and has more engineering content than just mechanical, a
                            joint recognition with other appropriate engineering societies is encouraged and should be
                            proposed.</p>
