                        <p> Pursuing a landmark designation is challenging and immensely rewarding. From the guidelines
                            and criteria, you can determine the likelihood of identifying a potential candidate for
                            landmarking. Some considerations:</p>
                        <p><strong>Who can nominate a landmark? Who approves it?</strong></p>
                        <p>Nominations may be submitted by any ASME member with the support of a sponsoring unit
                            (section or technical community of ASME). Using the nomination form provided, nominators
                            should submit the appropriate material at least one month prior to the next History and
                            Heritage Committee meeting. (To progress through the nomination stage, approval and then
                            planning a ceremony involves considerable support by the sponsoring unit and considerable
                            networking among various officers and participants. Nominators are encouraged to bring as
                            many of these participants on board as early as possible.)</p>
                        <p>To accept a nominated landmark (or "work") for recognition, the History and Heritage
                            Committee reviews the nomination and must conclude that landmarking the work is an
                            appropriate action for ASME. The Committee members' experience and knowledge of the work
                            play a role in this deliberation, but the content of the nomination documentation is the
                            primary and most important source that the Committee uses. (See <a class="InternalLink"
                                href="/About-ASME/History/Landmarks/About-the-Landmarks-Program/Landmarks-Criteria"
                                target="" title="Landmarks Criteria">Criteria</a>.)</p>
                        <p>To reach its conclusion, the Committee seeks affirmative answers to several questions. It is
                            critical that the nomination addresses the issues posed by the questions not by number, but
                            within the content of the nomination, in such a way that the Committee will find the
                            information that it needs for the review.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alteration, Removal, or Destruction of Landmark</strong></p>
                        <p>Does ASME landmark status mean that an artifact or collection cannot be altered, removed, or
                            destroyed?</p>
                        <p>No. The ASME designation does not have the force of law that a National Register designation
                            has. Therefore, an owner is free to alter or demolish the landmark. ASME hopes, however,
                            that this recognition will encourage the preservation of these examples of our industrial
                            heritage. If a landmark is destroyed or undergoes major alterations, its plaque must be
                            returned to ASME.</p>
                        <p><strong>ASME Plaque</strong></p>
                        <p>Who does the ASME plaque? ASME History and Heritage writes the wording and has the foundry
                            set the plaque, which is then given as a gift to the landmark owner, with the understanding
                            that it will be displayed on or near the designated item. This is usually arranged through
                            the sponsoring ASME unit.</p>
                        <p>ASME plaques provide information on the significance of the artifact, site or collection,
                            noting pertinent dates and people involved. Presentation of the plaque in a ceremony, held
                            by the sponsoring ASME unit, marks the formal designation and its addition to the ASME
                            Landmarks roster.</p>
                        <p>In some cases where the landmark has been destroyed or altered, owners have taken special
                            measures to preserve a record of it or near the site (open to the public). In these cases,
                            the ASME plaque has remained. An example is the <strong>Shippingport Atomic Power
                                Station</strong> near Pittsburgh. Although the reactor was decommissioned and removed, a
                            small museum was built at the site, containing the ASME plaque and other plaques, a model of
                            the reactor, and general information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Commemorative Brochure</strong></p>
                        <p>What else, besides submitting the nomination, does the nominating section ortechnical
                            communityhave to prepare prior to the designation? Landmarks require that the sponsoring
                            unit prepare and publish a commemorative brochure that meets with program approval. These
                            brochures become significant documentation for the membership, researchers, students, and
                            the public in understanding mechanical engineering achievements and important mechanical
                            engineers. Once a nomination is approved, brochure planning should be initiated since it
                            often takes the longest advance time of any element prior to the ceremony.</p>
