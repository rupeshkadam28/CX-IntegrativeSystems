<h3>Becoming an ASME.org Participant</h3>
<p><strong>Are existing members required to become ASME.org Participants?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, a member does not have to become a Participant. An unconverted member or
	customer can go to <a href="https://www.asme.org">www.asme.org</a> and sign in with the username and
	password that they previously used to sign in to their MYASME Account. They will have access to the
	following account information: Account Information, Membership &amp; Benefits Access, Purchase History, and
	Committee History. </p>

<p><strong>Why should existing members become Participants? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Becoming a Participant gives a member the ability to engage with ASME in a new way
	through our online engineering community. Participants can create Profiles, connect with other individuals
	with similar interests, and join and create Groups focused on engineering topics, including Groups for
	official ASME units. With this tool, Participants have the benefit of making their voices heard on the
	latest in engineering and ASME news while communicating with fellow engineers from around the world, all on
	one platform. </p>
<p><strong>Do existing members need to become Participants to access Member Benefits? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, a user does not have to become a Participant in order to access their Member
	Benefits. A non-converted user will have access to their Member Benefits through an abbreviated dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>Do existing members need to become Participants to participate in online ASME Groups? </strong></p>
<p> <strong>Answer: </strong>Yes, a member will have to become a participant in order to participate in ASME
	Groups. However, "public" Group content can be viewed by any user. </p>
<p><strong>Do users have to become Participants in order to purchase a product? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong> No, a user does not have to become a participant in order to purchase a product.
	Access to ASME products will still be available to ALL ASME users. </p>
<p><strong>If I don&rsquo;t want to become a Participant, where do I go to renew my membership dues or update my
		contact information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> An unconverted member or customer can go to <a href="http://www.asme.org/"
		title="http://www.asme.org/">www.asme.org</a> and sign in with the username and password that they
	previously used to sign in to their MYASME Account. They will have access to a Membership &amp; Benefits
	page that will provide the option to renew their membership. The user can also update their name, email
	address, phone number, and mailing address. </p>
