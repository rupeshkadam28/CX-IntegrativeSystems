                        <p>Detailed information about the ASME Foundation Swanson Fellowship: Advanced Manufacturing is
                            provided below.</p>
                        <p>This ASME Foundation Swanson Fellow would serve a one-year fellowship at the Advanced
                            Manufacturing National Program Office (NPO) hosted by the National Institute of Standards
                            and Technology (NIST), in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>

                        <p>This professional development opportunity is open to eligible individuals from the private
                            sector and government to serve our nation in fostering advanced manufacturing initiatives as
                            part of a nation-wide manufacturing agenda. The Advanced Manufacturing NPO was established
                            by the White House in 2012 to support U.S. industry in scaling-up the manufacturing of
                            future advanced technology goods within the U.S., serving to strengthen U.S. innovation
                            capacity and recover the U.S. taxpayer investment in early stage R&amp;D. It does so by
                            supporting the interagency coordination of advanced manufacturing programs, including the
                            President's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), providing a link to the
                            growing number of private-sector partnerships between manufacturers, universities, state and
                            local governments, and other manufacturing-related organizations.</p>

                        <p>While at the Advanced Manufacturing NPO, <em>Fellows</em> will:</p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li>Strengthen coordination between the National Program Office and other participating

                                federal agencies, and stakeholders of NNMI.</li>
                            <li>Provide alternative perspectives to strengthen the impact of advanced manufacturing
                                programs and better leverage government and partner investments across the national

                            <li>Strengthen the narrative that documents the role and significance of advanced
                                manufacturing among partners, constituents and the public.</li>
                            <li>Engage with professionals at the intersection of advanced manufacturing and public

                        <p><strong>ABOUT THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING NATIONAL PROGRAM OFFICE</strong></p>

                        <p>The Advanced Manufacturing NPO is staffed by representatives from federal agencies supporting
                            U.S. manufacturing and by Fellows from U.S. industry and academia. Participating agencies
                            include the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, and Energy, NASA, the National
                            Science Foundation, and others.</p>

                        <p>Two programs currently supported by NPO include the President's proposed National Network for
                            Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) and the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) Steering
                            Committee. At the present, the NNMI program is a growing network of the pilot Institutes to
                            support innovation in manufacturing across the United States which is being managed by the
                            interagency NPO. The NNMI fills a gap – the &quot;missing middle&quot; - between the
                            nation's R&amp;D, education and training activities and the deployment of technological
                            innovations and a skilled workforce in the domestic production of goods. AMP was established
                            by President Obama in 2011 as part of a continuing effort to maintain U.S. leadership in the
                            emerging technologies, to create high-quality manufacturing jobs and enhance America's
                            global competitiveness. AMP is comprised of leaders from industry, academia, and labor and
                            functions as a working group of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and
                            Technology (PCAST).</p>

                        <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>

                            The responsibilities may range from facilitating the advancement of multi-agency program
                            development teams, to reaching out to and interfacing with industry, academia and government
                            leaders as ambassadors of AMNPO and the federal government. As a result, the ASME Foundation
                            Swanson Fellow may play a critical role within the &quot;all of government&quot; interagency
                            team by leading, advising, and acting. Some examples of duties include:</p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li>Develop policies and practices that further the implementation of the President's agenda
                                in advanced manufacturing.</li>
                            <li>Assist in the formation, management and operation of the NNMI network that is to be
                                composed of each of the individual manufacturing innovation institutes.</li>
                            <li>Participate in the evaluation of the overall NNMI program.</li>
                            <li>Provide support and assist AMP in the development of recommendations.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Recruitment and Training</strong>

                            The Fellow would begin serving in September 2015 or January 2016, dependent upon their
                            availability. An ASME selection committee screens applications and will notify selected
                            candidates on February 25, 2015. Interviews with final candidates will be scheduled for
                            April 19, 2015. After the interviews, the selection committee may tentatively match
                            finalists with available fellowship opportunities. Selected fellows will receive offers no
                            later than April 30, 2015.</p>

                        <p>Fellows may be required to attend a two-week orientation course in Washington, DC, in
                            September 2015. Administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science
                            (AAAS), the course provides useful training and a foundation for a fellow's network that
                            serves as both a formal and informal resource for participants throughout the fellowship
                            year.</p>

                        <p><strong>Financial Support of Federal Government Fellows</strong>

                            ASME has a limited number of stipends of $80,000 per congressional/federal government
                            fellow. Because the stipend is not intended to be the fellow's entire financial support, the
                            remaining salary and other costs, including benefits, must be negotiated between the fellow
                            and his or her employer. Society members selected for congressional fellowships typically
                            take a one-year leave of absence from their employer.</p>
