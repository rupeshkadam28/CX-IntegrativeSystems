<h3>ASME Foundation Swanson Fellowship: Advanced Manufacturing NPO</h3>
<h3>CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS</h3>

<p>Detailed information about the ASME Foundation Swanson Fellowship: Advanced Manufacturing is
    provided below.</p>
<p>This ASME Foundation Swanson Fellow would serve a one-year fellowship at the Advanced
    Manufacturing National Program Office (NPO) hosted by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST), in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>

<p>This professional development opportunity is open to eligible individuals from the private
    sector and government to serve our nation in fostering advanced manufacturing initiatives as
    part of a nation-wide manufacturing agenda. The Advanced Manufacturing NPO was established
    by the White House in 2012 to support U.S. industry in scaling-up the manufacturing of
    future advanced technology goods within the U.S., serving to strengthen U.S. innovation
    capacity and recover the U.S. taxpayer investment in early stage R&amp;D. It does so by
    supporting the interagency coordination of advanced manufacturing programs, including the
    President's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), providing a link to the
    growing number of private-sector partnerships between manufacturers, universities, state and
    local governments, and other manufacturing-related organizations.</p>

<p>While at the Advanced Manufacturing NPO, <em>Fellows</em> will:</p>
<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>Strengthen coordination between the National Program Office and other participating
        organizations, including: industry, universities, state and regional authorities,
        federal agencies, and stakeholders of NNMI.</li>
    <li>Provide alternative perspectives to strengthen the impact of advanced manufacturing
        programs and better leverage government and partner investments across the national
        landscape.</li>
    <li>Strengthen the narrative that documents the role and significance of advanced
        manufacturing among partners, constituents and the public.</li>
    <li>Engage with professionals at the intersection of advanced manufacturing and public
        policy to make practical contributions in federal decision-making.</li>
    <li>Strengthen the understanding of federal policy and programs across stakeholder groups in
        advanced manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING NATIONAL PROGRAM OFFICE</strong></p>

<p>The Advanced Manufacturing NPO is staffed by representatives from federal agencies supporting
    U.S. manufacturing and by Fellows from U.S. industry and academia. Participating agencies
    include the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, and Energy, NASA, the National
    Science Foundation, and others.</p>

<p>Two programs currently supported by NPO include the President's proposed National Network for
    Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) and the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) Steering
    Committee. At the present, the NNMI program is a growing network of the pilot Institutes to
    support innovation in manufacturing across the United States which is being managed by the
    interagency NPO. The NNMI fills a gap â€“ the &quot;missing middle&quot; - between the
    nation's R&amp;D, education and training activities and the deployment of technological
    innovations and a skilled workforce in the domestic production of goods. AMP was established
    by President Obama in 2011 as part of a continuing effort to maintain U.S. leadership in the
    emerging technologies, to create high-quality manufacturing jobs and enhance America's
    global competitiveness. AMP is comprised of leaders from industry, academia, and labor and
    functions as a working group of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and
    Technology (PCAST).</p>

<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>

    The responsibilities may range from facilitating the advancement of multi-agency program
    development teams, to reaching out to and interfacing with industry, academia and government
    leaders as ambassadors of AMNPO and the federal government. As a result, the ASME Foundation
    Swanson Fellow may play a critical role within the &quot;all of government&quot; interagency
    team by leading, advising, and acting. Some examples of duties include:</p>
<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>Develop policies and practices that further the implementation of the President's agenda
        in advanced manufacturing.</li>
    <li>Assist in the formation, management and operation of the NNMI network that is to be
        composed of each of the individual manufacturing innovation institutes.</li>
    <li>Participate in the evaluation of the overall NNMI program.</li>
    <li>Provide support and assist AMP in the development of recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Recruitment and Training</strong>

    The Fellow would begin serving in September 2015 or January 2016, dependent upon their
    availability. An ASME selection committee screens applications and will notify selected
    candidates on February 25, 2015. Interviews with final candidates will be scheduled for
    April 19, 2015. After the interviews, the selection committee may tentatively match
    finalists with available fellowship opportunities. Selected fellows will receive offers no
    later than April 30, 2015.</p>

<p>Fellows may be required to attend a two-week orientation course in Washington, DC, in
    September 2015. Administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science
    (AAAS), the course provides useful training and a foundation for a fellow's network that
    serves as both a formal and informal resource for participants throughout the fellowship
    year.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Support of Federal Government Fellows</strong>

    ASME has a limited number of stipends of $80,000 per congressional/federal government
    fellow. Because the stipend is not intended to be the fellow's entire financial support, the
    remaining salary and other costs, including benefits, must be negotiated between the fellow
