				<h3>Dean Kamen, executive director of the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute
					(ARMI)/BioFabUSA, was the keynote speaker at the ASME Congressional Briefing, “Bioengineering: A New
					Frontier in American Manufacturing,” on June 14, 2018. </h3>
				<p>ASME recently hosted a congressional briefing on <em>Bioengineering: A New Frontier in American
						Manufacturing</em>. The event featured keynote speaker Dean Kamen, Executive Director of the
					Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI)/BioFabUSA, a Manufacturing USA institute
					focused on regenerative medicine. Kamen designed several major innovative technologies in the
					bioengineering sector, including the first portable insulin pump, the <em>iBot</em> all-terrain
					wheelchair, and the Segway. </p>

				<p>Kamen kicked off the briefing with the analogy, &ldquo;science is a goldmine, engineering is how you
					get it out of the ground and make it valuable.&rdquo; He discussed the mission of ARMI, explaining
					that it filled a role nobody else was tackling by focusing on engineering and scale, rather than
					basic research. Kamen explained that the future of biomanufacturing is the manufacturing of organs
					such as kidneys to replace those no longer functioning, rather than chronically treating them. This
					will save the government a lot of money, and have a correspondingly immeasurable impact on the cost
					of healthcare for all Americans. Looking to the future, Dean stated he hopes to turn Manchester, New
					Hampshire—where ARMI is located, along with several other biomanufacturing and advanced
					manufacturing companies such as Kamen&rsquo;s other company DEKA Research and Development—into an
					&ldquo;east coast version of Silicon Valley for organ reproduction,&rdquo; and &ldquo;transition to
					a world where regenerative organs are as common as vaccines.&rdquo; </p>

				<p>Following Kamen&rsquo;s presentation, Senator Shaheen provided remarks, expressing her excitement that
					the Department of Defense (DOD) played an integral part in helping ARMI get off the ground, further
					noting that DOD is a key player in advancing new technologies. The innovative new technologies ARMI is
					developing have immeasurable potential, including the ability to bring relief to patients on the organ
					donor list. These technologies also reinforce the major impact that science has on daily life, and the
					need to continue supporting our science agencies. Senator Shaheen also touched on the dearth of
					qualified scientists moving into the bioengineering field, explaining that the University of New
					Hampshire system is closely engaged with ARMI, but more must be done to encourage young people to pursue
					bioengineering. In closing, she conceded that the current costs of higher education are a barrier to
					prospective students. </p>

				<p>Following the Senators remarks, Michael Golway, President and CEO of Advanced Solutions Life Sciences,
					discussed some of the groundbreaking technology his company is working on. Advanced Solutions is a
					biomanufacturing company with locations all over the country, including their newest location with ARMI
					in Manchester, NH. He explained that the work of Advanced Solutions is a &ldquo;very small piece of the
					big puzzle&rdquo; Kamen discussed in his keynote address. Golway shared several videos with the audience
					of the BioAssemblyBot (BABs), a 3D bioassembly technology platform that is also the world&rsquo;s first
					human tissue printer. He explained that BABs moves like an arm and can also control workflow. Additional
					tools can also be attached to the arm for further functional variation.  In addition to BABs, Advanced
					Solutions is working on Patented Angiomics, a technology they have developed in conjunction with ARMI
					that harvests blood vessels from fat cell tissues, which then undergoes new angiogenesis. </p>

				<p>Rounding out the speaker panel was Jennifer Hagan-Dier, Director of the Tennessee Manufacturing Extension
					Partnership. She explained that the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is a public-private
					partnership with centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. It is dedicated to providing small and
					medium-sized manufacturers with the support they need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies, create new
					products and find new markets. The program is dedicated to bolstering the state of American
					manufacturing, as the investment in research and development from a manufacturing perspective has
					decreased significantly. Hagan-Dier further noted that what is frequently happening now in manufacturing
					is that products are being invented by American manufacturers, but the actual manufacturing is taking
					place somewhere else. One of the core missions of the MEP is to change this and revert to an
					&ldquo;Invent Here, Manufacture Here&rdquo; model once more. </p>
