<h3 >The <span>ECE Programming
        Committee</span> is working to expand
    the productionof FutureME Programs to reach early career engineers through several types of
    activities and venues</h3>
<p>The ECE Programming Committee and the ASME Old Guard have
    joined forces to provide both planning expertise and financial start-up grants to assist
    selected ASME units with production of FutureME Programs. FutureME Programs are conducted to
    aid early career and recent graduate engineers in making the transition and ramp-up from
    university to professional life.</p>
<h3>Grant Details</h3>
<p> The Grant may provideup to $1500 to assist in the sponsorship of each approved FutureME
    Program to be conducted. An additional $500 can be requested to assist in the sponsorship of
    approved FutureME Programs if the recipient agrees to provide video or written content in a
    form that can be used by the ECE Programming Committee. This content allows us to highlight
    ECE programs/activities happening in the ASME community and share valuable content to larger
    groups of engineers. For all video content, presenters will need to complete the <a
        href="https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get Involved/FutureME/Talent-Release-v3.pdf"
        target="_blank">talent release</a> form. </p>
<ul class="primary-list">
    <li>FutureME Programs should be focused on outreach to Early Career Engineers (working
        professionals or grad students, those that are 0-10 years from having received their
        undergraduate degrees).</li>
    <li>FutureME Programs should inspire and empower early career engineers to solve complex
        challenges in their local &amp; global communities. These activities can include
        problem-based learning and practical skill growth, encourage pathways of engagement
        within ASME, and provide interaction with subject matter experts and industry leaders in
        order to create diverse &amp; engaged ECE communities. </li>
    <li>FutureME Programs may be organized and conducted by any ASME unit (a &ldquo;Sponsoring
        Group&rdquo;): Section, Sub-Section, Technical Division, Technical Chapter, Group or
        collaboration between more than one group.</li>
    <li>FutureME Program Grants will be distributed on a geographical basis at the discretion of
        the ECE Programming Committee and the Old Guard.</li>
    <li>The FutureME Program to be conducted must prominently recognize<em>&ldquo;The ASME Old
            Guard and the </em><em>ECE Programming Committee&rdquo;</em>as a sponsor or
        cosponsor of the program. Examples are:</li>
</ul>
<p>FutureME Mini-talk, FutureME Forum, or ASME Section FutureME Program... Sponsored by the ASME
    Old Guard &amp; the ASME ECE Programming Committee</p>
<p> The FutureME Program should align with the Student &amp; Early Career Development Sector <a
        href="https://community.asme.org/student_early_career_development/w/wiki/6955.about-us.aspx">Vision,
        Mission and Objectives</a>. </p>
<p>Corporate and other sponsors should also be appropriately recognized.</p>
