                        <p>ASME recently convened a congressional staff briefing titled, &ldquo;Lasers for America:
                            Driving Advancements in Science, National Security, Manufacturing, Health, and U.S.
                            Competitiveness.&rdquo; The briefing, which was held Dec. 12, followed = the release of a
                            National Academies of Sciences (NAS) study, titled &ldquo;Opportunities in Intense Ultrafast
                            Lasers: Reaching for the Brightest Light.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The NAS study, which was conducted at the request of the Department of Energy, the Office of
                            Naval Research and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, evaluates the current state
                            of high-intensity, ultrafast lasers and laser technologies, and assesses the value of future
                            high-intensity laser science programs and facilities in the United States and around the
                            world.</p>
                        <p>U.S. investments in science and technology led to the development of the laser in 1960. Since
                            then, the laser has become a ubiquitous tool across a broad range of applications. The laser
                            is now used to perform cutting edge experiments at advanced particle accelerators, to aid in
                            the development of advanced materials for national security applications, and to enable
                            novel treatments to treat cancer and other medical conditions. Today, the worldwide laser
                            market is valued at roughly $10.5 billion and growing annually.</p>

                                delivered opening remarks at the event.

                        <p>Another major breakthrough in laser technologies, again led by researchers in the United
                            States, is the short-pulse, high-peak power laser. This new class of laser could have
                            transformative applications with far reaching impact, including the development of small,
                            compact particle accelerators that are a fraction of the length of contemporary accelerator
                            systems, or powerful new specialized medical treatment and scanning capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Despite the United States&rsquo; early lead in this technology, the country is at risk of
                            losing its competitive advantage. According to the NAS study, countries in Europe and Asia
                            are investing heavily in this foundational technology and plan to overtake the U.S. At the
                            same time, U.S. federal investment in the research and development of high-peak power lasers
                            has been declining significantly, leaving American researchers and companies vulnerable to
                            international competition.</p>
                        <p>ASME partnered with internationally recognized scientists and representatives from American
                            industry for the Dec. 12 briefing to provide insights to policymakers on the current state
                            of laser science and technology development. Panelists discussed the key role that lasers
                            play in U.S. innovation and economic competitiveness, and how the nation can maintain
                            preeminence in laser technology.</p>

                            expertise from across industry and academia. Taking part in the panel were E. Michael
                            Campbell, director of the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester;
