<h3>ASME's Breadth of Offerings</h3>
<p>ASME offers the public and private sectors a comprehensive portfolio of codes and standards
    offerings, which govern elevators and escalators. The Society develops and maintains eight
    major codes addressing safety in design, construction, installation, operation, inspection,
    testing, maintenance, alteration, and repair of elevators, dumbwaiters, escalators, moving
    walks, material lifts, and dumbwaiters with automatic transfer devices, wheelchair lifts, or
    inclined-stairway chair lifts. Thus, ASME extends its broad perspective on safety across a
    full range of industry products and applications.</p>

<h3>ASME On the Cutting Edge</h3>
<p>ASME continues to set the pace in the elevator-and-escalator industry. Its A17 Elevator and
    Escalator Committee has successfully released a series of bi-national codes in concert with
    the Canadian Standards Association. </p>
<p>One of these new bi-national codes, A17.7-2007/CSA B44.7-07, serves as a model for the
    parallel existence of a prescriptive technical code and a performance-based standard,
    covering the same equipment within a regulated industrial sector. This combination
    introduces flexibility to an industry that is sometimes best served by clearly defined rules
    (prescriptive) and other times needs performance targets that can be met by a wide range of
    solutions, encouraging competition in the industry.</p>
<p>ASME is pleased to add this progressive approach to its own proven methodologies as yet
    another contribution to fostering international trade and technology transfer.</p>
<p>ASME's codes and standards offerings in elevators and escalators are detailed in the
    following pages. These include codes and standards in both print and digital formats, along
    with companion training courses and videos. We strive to provide the codes-of-choice for
    your company…and your country. </p>

<h3>The Industry Speaks about ASME Safety Codes and Standards</h3>
<p><em>In terms of importance of ASME Codes and Standards across the entire spectrum, it's
        important to recognize the Society publishes something over 500 standards. They affect
        equipment and comfort features of our lives every way and every day, from a heating
        system, a cooling system, an elevator, an escalator, elements of your automobiles,
        bolts, nuts, fasteners, plumbing, the list is endless. But these are safety aspects that
        contribute to the quality of life. In part, this is what engineers do. So while much of
        the populous may never realize that their life is touched and impacted by ASME Codes and
        Standards, rare is the day that it isn't.</em></p>
<p>— James W. Coaker, Coaker & Co. PC</p>
<p><em>Our intention is safety. We want make sure that everybody else in the industry does the
        same thing. And you can only do that by having a uniform standard, because otherwise
        everyone will have their own interpretations of how safety should be implemented. The
        standards create a baseline for safety in the broadest context and this contribution is
        immeasurably valuable
        ...Because of the consensus process we have over here—which has a tremendous amount of
        scrutiny and a tremendous amount of thought and effort involved in the upfront process
        of developing standards—the standards are of an extremely high quality.</em></p>
<p>— Louis Bialy, Director, Worldwide Codes & Standards, Otis Elevator Co. </p>
<p><em>I think the ASME Codes and Standards committees' most important work is to be able to
        provide consistency throughout the nation and through North America…An elevator is an
        elevator and if you build an elevator in California, you should be able to sell it in
        Ohio, and if you build it in Ohio, you should be able to sell it in Ontario. As such, I
        think the consistency across the board with the North American standards has allowed
        that to occur; provide a base level of safety, and allow each jurisdiction to be able to
        enforce it properly.</em></p>
<p>— Norman B. Martin, Chief Elevator Inspector, State of Ohio</p>
<p><em>People physically interact with elevators routinely to the degree that they take it for
        granted every day. The first thing they do when they come to work is come into a
        building, push the button, get in the elevator, and ride the elevator up to their
        workstation, and do that throughout the day and return home. That interaction requires
        that there be a very high degree of focus on public safety in the transportation
        systems.
        The fact that ASME is able to support the administrative effort of the A17 work is very
        important, because the focus of the elevator industry has always been on public safety.
        So I think that's a tremendous benefit to the elevator industry to have that capability
        administered by ASME.</em></p>
<p>— Robert S. "Bob" Caporale, Editor, Elevator World, Inc.</p>

<h3>Participating on ASME Codes and Standards Committees</h3>
<p>The success of ASME Codes & Standards is founded on enduring relationships with stakeholders
    in a broad range of industries. Our most valuable assets are our relationships with the
    volunteer members who serve on Codes & Standards committees. ASME Safety Codes and Standards
    are developed in a committee setting to ensure balanced participation and open access to
    public interest groups. </p>
<h4>Committee Composition</h4>
<p>ASME safety committee(s) and supporting technical subcommittee(s) consist of experts from
    various stake-holder groups, who provide their time and resources on a voluntary basis. The
    success of ASME codes and standards is based on technical and operational experience from
    stakeholders drawn from a broad range of industries. Volunteer members who participate on
    ASME committee(s) play a vital role in ensuring that the safety and design requirements
    contained in the standards remain relevant to the ever-changing work environment and
    equipment. They also gain unique opportunities to expand their professional networks and
    technical resources.</p>
<h4>Membership Participation</h4>
<p>There are no fees or geographical restrictions associated with membership on ASME Committee
    activities and ASME membership, while desirable, is not required. </p>
<p>Applicants are selected based primarily on technical expertise. ASME uses an Internet-based,
    voting-and-tracking system, which allows committee members and other interest parties to
    participate in ongoing business from anywhere in the world. The committee meets on an
    on-going basis, as needed, to discuss changing industry needs and best operational
    practices.</p>

<h3>About ASME Safety Codes and Standards</h3>
<p>ASME plays an active role in protecting the public through the development of Safety Codes and Standards, which are
