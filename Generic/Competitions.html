                      <h2>The Competitions</h2>
                      <p>We’re excited to announce that the Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC), the Innovative
                          Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge (IAM3D), the Student Design Competition and the Old
                          Guard Competition will now be taking place at ASME’s global E-Fests (Engineering Festivals).
                          E-Fests are three-day, two-night regional events built around design, advanced manufacturing
                          and robotics technologies. They enable engineering students to expand their knowledge, test
                          and showcase new skills and inspire innovation. </p>

                      <p>In the Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D (IAM3D) Challenge students showcase their
                          creativity by demonstrating the value added through their ingenuity, application of sound
                          engineering design principles, and leveraging Additive Manufacturing technology to address a
                          broad spectrum of industrial, manufacturing, and humanitarian challenges.</p>

                      <p>The ASME Student Design Competition provides a platform for ASME Student Members to present
                          their solutions to a range of design problems-– from everyday household tasks to
                          groundbreaking space exploration. Each team is required to design, construct and operate a
                          prototype meeting the requirements of an annually determined problem statement. </p>

                      <p>An engineer, like all professionals, must possess a well-developed ability to communicate,
                          both orally and in writing. This competition is designed to emphasize the value of an
                          ability to deliver oral presentations. </p>
