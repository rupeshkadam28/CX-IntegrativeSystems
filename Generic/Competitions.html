                      <h2>The Competitions</h2>
                      <p>We’re excited to announce that the Human Powered Vehicle Challenge (HPVC), the Innovative
                          Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge (IAM3D), the Student Design Competition and the Old
                          Guard Competition will now be taking place at ASME’s global E-Fests (Engineering Festivals).
                          E-Fests are three-day, two-night regional events built around design, advanced manufacturing
                          and robotics technologies. They enable engineering students to expand their knowledge, test
                          and showcase new skills and inspire innovation. </p>

                      <p>The ASME Student Design Competition provides a platform for ASME Student Members to present
                          their solutions to a range of design problems-– from everyday household tasks to
                          groundbreaking space exploration. Each team is required to design, construct and operate a
                          prototype meeting the requirements of an annually determined problem statement. </p>
