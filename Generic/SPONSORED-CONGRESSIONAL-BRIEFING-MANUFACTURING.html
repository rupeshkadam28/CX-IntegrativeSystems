                        <h3>Background:</h3>

                        <p>The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established the &ldquo;Manufacturing
                            Engineering Education Grant Program,&rdquo; thereby authorizing the Defense Department to
                            support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions
                            of higher education, universities, industry, and nonprofit institutions. Grantees are
                            selected through a competitive process on the merits of better aligning their educational
                            offerings with the needs of modern U.S. manufacturers.</p>

                        <p>This new program has great potential to strengthen national security and increase economic
                            competitiveness by improving and modernizing the U.S. industrial base. Through this program,
                            students, technologists, and manufactures will be better equipped to manufacture U.S.
                            military equipment and technology domestically, protecting and securing the future of the
                            American Warfighter. The Manufacturing Engineering Education Grant Program will not only
                            strengthen the U.S. military&rsquo;s capabilities, but will also allow the U.S. to compete
                            against other nations economically as well.</p>

                        <p>In the area of advanced manufacturing, the U.S. is currently competing commercially against a
                            range of European and Asian nations for global innovation advantage in areas of advanced
                            manufacturing. Countries such as Germany and Austria, who dedicate a larger percentage of
                            their economy to manufacturing (23% and 19% respectively) than the United States (12%) are
                            pursuing several workforce development initiatives that call for revamping engineering
                            curriculum and workforce training opportunities to better align manufacturing and
                            engineering education more closely with the current and future needs of industry.</p>
