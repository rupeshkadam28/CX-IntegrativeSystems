<h3>Sharing A Common Vision and Purpose</h3>
<p>ASME’s strategic partnerships offer our community of engineers a broad range of networking and relationship
    building opportunities. Key partnerships include...</p>
<h3 class="big">Membership Partners</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/"><strong>Engineers Without Borders - USA</strong></a> is a nonprofit
    humanitarian organization established to support community-driven development programs worldwide through
    partnerships that design and implement sustainable engineering projects. EWB-USA members, comprised of
    professional and student engineers or other disciplines, work with local communities and NGOs in over 45
    developing countries around the world on projects such as water, renewable energy, sanitation and more. Find out
    about our <a href="#">joint membership</a> offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nsbe.org/"><strong>National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)</strong></a>, with more
    than 35,700 members, is one of the largest student-governed organizations in the country. Founded in 1975, NSBE
    now includes more than 394 College, Pre-College, and Technical Professional/Alumni chapters in the United States
    and abroad. NSBE’s mission is <em>"to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel
        academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community."</em> ASME members are eligible
    for a 50% discounted membership to NSBE.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.shpe.org/"><strong>Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)</strong></a> was
    founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their
    objective was to form a national organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Hispanic
    community. The concept of networking was the key basis for the organization. SHPE quickly established two
    student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries outside
    the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent network of professional and student chapters
    throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.swe.org/"><strong>Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</strong></a> is a not-for-profit
    educational and service organization that empowers women to succeed and advance in the field of engineering, and
    to be recognized for their life-changing contributions as engineers and leaders. Founded in 1950, SWE is the
    driving force that establishes engineering as a highly desirable career for women through an exciting array of
    training and development programs, networking opportunities, scholarships, outreach and advocacy activities, and
    much more.</p>
<h3>Outreach Partners</h3>
<p>Girls push boundaries, test limits, and look at the world around them with inquisitive eyes. They're natural
    scientists. <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_central/science/"><strong>GirlScouts</strong></a>
    introduces girls of every age to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities that are relevant
    to everyday life. Whether they're discovering how a car's engine runs, becoming math whizzes, or learning about
    careers in STEM fields, girls are moving forward into the future. They can host science fairs, design Web sites,
    plan for space exploration, visit geological sites and more</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.boyscouts.org/"><strong>Boy Scouts of America</strong></a> relies on dedicated volunteers
    to promote its mission of preparing young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetime by
    instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Today, nearly 1.2 million adults provide
    leadership and mentoring to Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Venturers. ASME partnered with Boy Scouts of America to
    write the criteria for the engineering merit badge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.eweek.org/"><strong>Engineers Week</strong></a> coalition partner organizations –
    corporations and non-profits alike – are working together to cultivate the next generation of engineers and to
    celebrate the engineering profession. Join the effort!</p>
