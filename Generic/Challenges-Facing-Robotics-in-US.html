                      <p>ASME recently sponsored a briefing on Capitol Hill to highlight &ldquo;Robotics in the
                          Manufacturing Environment: An Insider&rsquo;s Look at Advanced Technologies in the United
                          States&rdquo;. The event was cosponsored by The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon, the
                          Computing Research Association, IEEE-USA, and the Robotic Industries Association (RIA), and
                          convened in conjunction with the Congressional Robotics Caucus and the Congressional
                          Manufacturing Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives. The purpose of the briefing was
                          to inform Members of Congress and congressional staff on what industry leaders are doing to
                          prepare for the future adoption of robotics technologies in the manufacturing environment.
                      </p>

                      <p>ASME brought together a panel of leading experts in the field of robotics to share their
                          thoughts and insights on opportunities and challenges facing the future of manufacturing
                          robotics, as well as how government, industry and universities are collaborating to ensure
                          the U.S. maintains leadership in robotics. ASME Executive Director Tom Costabile kicked off
                          the event with welcoming remarks. He discussed the importance of embracing technological
                          advancements in manufacturing robotics while remaining mindful of its effect on the American
                          workforce. ASME President Said Jahanmir echoed this sentiment, noting that, &ldquo;As we
                          continue to see a rise in the integration of robotics and automation technology into our
                          daily lives, it&rsquo;s important to understand that along with the ease and benefits this
                          technology provides, it also comes with its share of challenges.&rdquo; He then introduced
                          Congressmen Mike Doyle (D-PA) and Rob Woodall (R-GA), co-chairs of the Congressional
                          Robotics Caucus, who discussed the importance of partnerships between the manufacturing,
                          education and workforce development sectors. </p>

                      <p>Dr. Byron Clayton, chief executive officer of the Manufacturing USA Advanced Robotics for
                          Manufacturing (ARM) Institute, began the panel discussion with a presentation addressing a
                          challenge that is prevalent within the world of engineering: workforce development. He
                          commented that an increasingly common issue for many employers today is that students are
                          coming out of school ill-prepared for the workforce, which includes a lack of understanding
                          and knowledge of codes and standards. Dr. Clayton commented that this leaves many fearing
                          that an increased presence of robots in the workplace will nullify the need for the American
                          worker in the future, but that this worry can be diminished with adequate preparation as
                          robots and human workers are most effective when they support one another and work in
                          tandem. </p>



                      <p> Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation (A3) and the Robotic
                          Industries Association, (RIA), followed Dr. Clayton&rsquo;s presentation. In his remarks,
                          Burnstein pointed out that automation and robots in factories is not a new phenomenon. He
                          stressed that robots have been in factories for more than 50 years, and that the technology
                          was pioneered right here in the U.S, but that U.S. leadership in robotics technology is
                          rapidly waning. Burnstein noted that the U.S. is no longer among the top five
                          technologically advanced countries and is currently ranking behind countries such as Korea,
                          Japan, and Germany. One factor these more technologically adept countries share is that they
                          have ardently embraced robots for some time. China too is now rapidly ascending through the
                          ranks thanks in part to government initiatives and programs that specifically call for
                          industry to embrace robots. Burnstein cautioned that if the U.S. fails to get on board with
                          robots in the workplace, its rank among technologically advanced nations will only continue
                          to decrease. </p>

                      <p> Following Burnstein&rsquo;s presentation, Milton Guerry, president of the customer- and
                          industry-focused SCHUNK USA team, presented to the audience. Guerry began by showing
                          examples of robot prototypes that have been developed to work in conjunction with workers
                          and keep them safe in factory settings rather than replace them in their job functions. He
                          elaborated on points made by Burnstein, explaining that, &ldquo;Robotics is a technology
                          that is keeping us competitive.&rdquo; He went on to say that China is deploying robots at
                          an astounding rate, with the worldwide supply of robots projected to grow by 65 percent from
                          2016 to 2019 by 65 percent, and while the U.S. is playing a part, other economies are
                          playing a significantly larger role and reaping the benefits. </p>

                      <p> Dr. Charles Thorpe, dean of the School and Arts and Sciences at Clarkson University and
                          co-chair of the ASME Robotics Public Policy Task Force, rounded out the panelists with some
                          closing remarks. Dr. Thorpe previously served as an ASME Federal Government Fellow in the
                          White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and as assistant director for Advanced
                          Manufacturing and Robotics as part of the White House team that created the National
                          Advanced Manufacturing Initiative. In discussing the need to embrace these new technological
                          advances, Thorpe said, &ldquo;We talk a lot in [Washington, D.C.] about whole-of-government
                          efforts. This can&rsquo;t be a whole-of-government effort, this has to be a whole-of-country
                          effort.&rdquo; He stressed the need for strong public-private partnerships, with federal,
                          state, and local governments working in conjunction with industry and academia to strengthen
                          the United States&rsquo; overall research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, and embrace
                          advanced robotic technology. </p>

                          engineering champions in Congress to discuss a wide range of issues important to ASME. Along
                          with his longtime friend, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Costabile also met with Reps. Mike
                          Doyle (D-PA), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), Dan Lipinski (D-IL), Tom Reed (R-NY), Paul Tonko

                          integrity, clean energy and manufacturing, as well as standards in the robotics industry and
                          science, technology, engineering and mathematics. </p>

                      <p>During these visits, Costabile also stressed the importance of ASME&rsquo;s Federal
                          Government Fellowship program which provides engineers with the opportunity to serve in the
                          Executive or Legislative branches of government for one year. The offices of Reps. Lipinski
                          and Reed &mdash; currently hosting ASME Congressional Fellows Laurel Kuxhaus and KC Morris,
                          respectively &mdash; expressed their deep appreciation for the program and their eagerness
                          to host more Congressional Fellows in the future. </p>
