                      <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>

                      <p>Did you know that almost 50 percent of early career engineers lack standards knowledge? ASME
                          project, Vision 2030, assessed ME education in the U.S. by surveying 2500 industry
                          engineering supervisors, early career mechanical engineers and ME Department Heads and found
                          that 46.9% of industry supervisors state a weakness of standards understanding among BSME
                          graduates and 48.3% of early career engineers state their own weakness of standards
                          understanding. Find out different ways to get involved in <a

                      <p>Standards are everywhere. In fact, essentially all modern mechanical devices rely on one or
                          more engineering standards in their manufacturing processes. Standards provide efficiency,
                          produce standardized products, improve trade and commerce, and perhaps, most important, meet
                          safety and quality objectives. Manufacturing to a certain standard implies a certain level
                          of quality to the customer.</p>
                      <p>Standard – A set of technical definitions, instructions, rules, guidelines, or
                          characteristics set forth to provide consistent and comparable results, including:</p>
                      <ul class="primary-list">
                          <li>Items manufactured uniformly, providing for interchangeability</li>
                          <li>Tests and analyses conducted reliably, minimizing the uncertainty of the results</li>
                          <li>Facilities designed and constructed for safe operation</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>During a time when there were few, if any, operating guidelines and inspections for steam
                          pressure systems, many boilers were unsafe. Partly due to the explosion of the steamship
                          Sultana and the increase in boiler explosions and accidents, the American Society of
                          Mechanical Engineers was founded in 1880. Read more about ASME&rsquo;s founders, the

                      <p>Beginning with the first ASME standard published in 1884, ASME has worked to maintain its
                          founders&rsquo; vision of developing standards that would ensure safety, reliability, and
                          operational efficiency. Find out more on the <a

                      <p><strong>HOW ARE ASME STANDARDS DEVELOPED? </strong>

                          Each ASME standard is developed (and maintained) by one or more volunteer committees
                          comprised of subject matter experts. These committees are tasked with incorporating
                          advancements in technology and lessons-learned from real world use in order to ensure the
                          standard continues to be relevant to the industries that use it. Members of ASME Standards
                          &amp; Certification committees are technically qualified individuals with a concern and
                          willingness to participate in the scope of work of a given standard.</p>

                      <p><strong>IMPACT OF STANDARDS</strong>

                          Past, present, and future growth of technology introduces new standards and prompts the
                          revision of existing standards. Aside from technology, there are also many different aspects
                          of industry that influence standards. Standards promote the aim of prosperity with safety.
                          See how standards evolve with the changes in technology and industry and how standards get
                          developed for emerging industries, by taking a look at the following ASME articles.</p>
