        <h2>
          How it Works</h2>
        <p>ASME pre-paid members make a one-time dues payment in an amount determined as a multiple
          of the members’ age, and the total number of membership years remaining to qualify as a
          dues-exempt
          ASME Life Member.*</p>
        <p>Simply send an email using this link to <a
            href="mailto:CSG@asme.org?subject=Pre-Paid Membership Quote">request a pre-paid
            membership quote</a>, and an ASME Customer Care Representative will reply promptly with
          your quote and all the information you need to complete the process – it’s that easy!</p>

        <h2>
          Example</h2>

        <p>A 32 year old who has been a member for six years would receive a quote of $2,768 USD,
          (includes all dues
          and service charges for the next 29 years, and the service charges for all years to follow
          as a Life Member). <u> That’s a savings of over $1,553 at our current rates!</u>

        <h2>
          Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <p><strong>What is the difference between Pre-paid Membership and Life Membership?</strong></p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li><u>Pre-paid</u> is not a grade of membership, but rather a one-time discounted dues
            payment for the years
            prior to dues-exempt Life membership eligibility, and the service charges for the years
            as a Life member.
            * <u>Life membership</u> is a grade of membership which is achieved when a member has
            accumulated 35
            years of paid membership and is retired and/or 65 years of age. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How would I renew or add annual publication subscriptions, or make my annual
            contribution to the ASME Foundation? </strong></p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>As a pre-paid member, you will continue to receive an annual notice where you can add
            subscriptions, and/or make your annual Foundation contribution, or you can <a
              href="http://www.asme.org/about-asme/get-involved/asme-foundation/make-a-gift">donate
              now</a>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Is pre-paid membership available to student members?</strong></p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>No, pre-paid membership is only available to (professional) members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Do the number of years as a member to-date need to be continuous, and do years as a
            student member count?</strong></p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li><u>For pre-paid membership</u>, it is the total number of years as a paid member with or
            without breaks that count.
            Years as a student member count for those joining for the first time after the year
            2000. <u>For Life membership</u>, only years as a paid (professional) member count
            towards eligibility, with or without
            breaks. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>I have already renewed my membership through September 2018, do I need to wait until
            my next renewal to
            apply for pre-paid membership? </strong></p>
        <ul class="primary-list">
          <li>No, your current active membership is added to your total number of years as a member
            and considered in your
            quote. When the next renewal period begins, you will only receive notices for the
            purpose of renewing/adding
            subscriptions and making annual contributions.</li>
        </ul>
