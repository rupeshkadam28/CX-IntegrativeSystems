                      <p>ASME recently convened a Congressional Briefing titled “Strengthening American’s
                          Manufacturing Heartland” in partnership with the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
                          (AIChE). The briefing, which took place Dec. 14, was held at the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center
                          in Washington, D.C.</p>
                      <p>The briefing opened with remarks from June Wispelwey, executive director of AIChE, the lead
                          organization for Manufacturing USA’s Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment
                          (RAPID) Institute. Wispelwey highlighted the important role the RAPID Institute plays in
                          developing advancing breakthrough technologies to boost energy production, as well as the
                          importance of the Manufacturing USA program as a whole in enhancing domestic manufacturing
                          capabilities to meet the nation’s goal of increasing energy production by 20 percent in five
                          years. </p>
                      <p>ASME Legislative Fellow Andy Bicos, who serves in the office of Congressman Tom Reed (R-NY),
                          moderated the event, which featured the following panelists: Karen Fletcher, chief executive
                          officer of RAPID Institute; Billy Bardin, global operations technology director for Dow
                          Chemical Company; Mark Gaalswyk, founder and chairman of Easy Energy Systems; Thomas
                          Hedberg, co-leader of the Smart Manufacturing Systems Test Bed at the National Institutes of
                          Standards and Technology; and T. Bond Calloway, president of AIChE and the associate
                          laboratory director at Savannah River National Laboratory.</p>

                              Mark Gaalswyk (at podium), founder and chairman of Easy Energy Systems, was one of the
                              panelists discussing the importance of advanced manufacturing technologies and
                              public-private partnerships, such as Manufacturing USA, to the future of American
                              manufacturing.

                      <p> During the briefing, the panelists discussed how innovative technologies are investments in
                          the future of American manufacturing and the American Midwest — an area of the country that
                          has been particularly hard hit by the decline in well-paid manufacturing jobs. They stressed
                          that when businesses of all sizes from across the country work together on early-stage,
                          pre-competitive research, they can overcome their toughest technology challenges and
                          accelerate impact.</p>
                      <p> Each speaker touched upon the importance of working in partnership with academia and
                          government, as such ventures unleash manufacturing efficiency and energy savings, streamline
                          readiness and supply, improve flexibility, set standards, and develop a modern U.S.
                          workforce. </p>
                      <p> A number of public-private partnerships, including Manufacturing USA, are convening
                          companies, universities, industrial research organizations, and national laboratories to
                          accelerate new technologies to increase U.S. competitiveness and secure America’s future.
                      </p>
                      <p>Advanced manufacturing technologies are having an impact in a broad range of industries,
                          including chemicals, oil and gas, composites, textiles, food, pharmaceuticals, and pulp and
                          paper. As these advances continue to enable innovations in other fields, stakeholders are
                          beginning the critical next step of developing and standardizing manufacturing best
                          practices across industries, the panelists said.</p>
