                        <p> To nominate an artifact, collection or site for ASME designation is a formal procedure
                            outlined in the History and Heritage Manual (MS-72), available from Information Central or
                            Public Information. Any ASME member can nominate an item with the support of a sponsoring
                            ASME unit, such as a Section or Division. <a class="ResourceFile"

                                target="_blank" title="H&amp;H Landmark Nomination Form">Nominations forms</a> must be
                            completed and submitted appropriately one month prior to the next History and Heritage
                            Committee meeting. Before reviewing the <a class="InternalLink"

                                target="" title="Criteria">Criteria</a>, here are four questions you can answer to begin
                            consideration:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Is the nominated item an example of mechanical engineering?</strong>

                                Other societies recognize civil, electrical, etc., works. For an item to qualify for an
                                ASME designation, it must be primarily mechanical in nature. This can, however, be a
                                significant mechanical component of a nonmechanical work, such as the engine of a ship.
                                In such a case the mechanical component must be of landmark quality in its own right.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Does the nominated item represent a genuine advance in the practice of
                                    mechanical engineering?</strong>

                                Landmarks are those signal achievements that represent significant changes in how things
                                are done. This can be a new technology, a major improvement in an existing technology,
                                or a significant new application of a technology. A representative example of an
                                unusually common item also may be considered as being the most successful design within
                                a particular technology.</li>
                            <li><strong>Did the nominated item make a worthwhile contribution to the human
                                    condition?</strong>

                                Anything worthy of designation must have made a positive contribution to humanity,
                                society, and the engineering profession. ASME does not wish to recognize engineering
                                advances intentionally designed to do harm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Is the nominated item the best example of its kind?
                                </strong> Why should this particular item be the one designated? The Committee looks for
                                an item that is the first of its kind, the oldest surviving example, the most complete
                                surviving example, or an item in (nearly)original or in-service condition. Where many
                                equivalent examples exist, overall condition and public accessibility may be considered
                                in selecting the item to nominate.</li>
                        </ol>
