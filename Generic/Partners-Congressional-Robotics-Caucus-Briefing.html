                        <p>ASME recently partnered with the Robotics Caucus Advisory Committee and the Congressional
                            Robotics Caucus to convene a briefing for Congressional staff on the anticipated arrival and
                            integration of automated vehicles (AVs) into the United States&rsquo; transportation
                            infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>The Congressional Robotics Caucus, chaired by Congressman Rob Woodall (R-GA) and Congressman
                            Mike Doyle (D-PA), focuses on issues facing the robotics industry, including technological
                            as well as legal and regulatory challenges. Both Congressmen Woodall and Doyle addressed the
                            audience during the event, which took place Oct. 24 in the Rayburn House Office Building on
                            Capitol Hill, and shared their excitement for the economic and societal benefits AV
                            technology will provide, while also expressing their commitment to addressing policy
                            concerns. The briefing was co-hosted by IEEE-USA and Carnegie Mellon University, who are
                            members of the Robotics Caucus Advisory Committee along with ASME.</p>

                            In addition to hearing from the Caucus co-chairs, Deputy Assistant Secretary Finch Fulton
                            spoke to the role of the Federal government in integrating automated vehicles. He remarked
                            that the U.S. Department of Transportation recently released new guidelines for automated
                            driving systems in &ldquo;A Vision for Safety 2.0,&rdquo; and is already working on version
                            3.0 to be released in 2018.</p>
                        <p>After the opening remarks, incoming ASME President-Nominee Said Jahanmir, Ph.D., moderated
                            the panel session featuring experts who provided their insights on where the government
                            should play a role and what issues the government should be addressing proactively.
                            Panelists included Chuck Thorpe, Ph.D., chair of the ASME Robotics Public Policy Task Force
                            and dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Clarkson University; Constantine Samaras,
                            Ph.D., assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon
                            University; and Joe Jarzombek, global manager of the Software Integrity Group at Synopsys

                                primarily consisting of Congressional staffers, attended the briefing at the Rayburn

                            thinking about while researchers and industry race towards full AV integration. During the
                            event, it became clear that while the benefits automated vehicles promise are vast, AVs face
                            major societal obstacles as they are integrated into society, such as how to deter malicious
                            activities aimed at connected vehicles, where and to what extent the technology should be
                            utilized, and how to prepare a sufficient infrastructure that moves at the same pace as the
                            technology. All of the panelists noted that it is necessary for policymakers to consider
                            these far-reaching impacts as technologists continue to improve and innovate AV
                            capabilities.</p>
