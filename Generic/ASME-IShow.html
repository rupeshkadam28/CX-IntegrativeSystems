<p><strong>A Global Competition for Hardware Led Social Innovation </strong></p>
<p>The ASME Innovation showcase (ISHOW) is a global competition for hardware led ventures. We focus on
	the design & engineering journey of taking physical products to market. We care about “social
	innovation”, that is, solving social and environmental issues through enterprise. We host ISHOW
	events in Africa, India and the USA and accept submissions globally. Winners share cash prizes and
	design &amp; engineering support. We are a global network of engineers, makers, dreamers, designers,
	investors and entrepreneurs. Join us.</p>
