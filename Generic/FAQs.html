                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">How can I apply for a job at ASME?</strong> It's
                            simple
                            just click on the job that interests you listed under
                            <a href="/about-asme/who-we-are/careers-at-asme/job-opportunities">Job Opportunities</a> and
                            follow the directions at the
                            bottom of the post and submit your information.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">What documents do you need me to send to
                                you?</strong> When applying for a job please submit a
                            cover letter, an updated resume, and your salary
                            requirements in either .doc or .pdf file format.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">Will you contact me regarding the status of my
                                applications?</strong> We regret that we can't reply personally to each submission. Once
                            resumes for an open position have been reviewed, an ASME recruiter will contact the
                            best-qualified candidates for additional information and to schedule interviews.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">I don't see the job or location I am interested
                                in can I still submit my resume/CV to ASME?</strong> To maximize your chances of
                            success, we would encourage you to apply directly to an advertised open position. Start by
                            locating a position posted on our <a
                                href="/about-asme/who-we-are/careers-at-asme/job-opportunities">Job Opportunities</a>
                            page.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">How does the recruiting process work?</strong>
                            ASME has created a reference to give you an understanding of <a
                                href="/about-asme/who-we-are/careers-at-asme/our-recruiting-process">our recruiting
                                process</a>.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">Are professional references checked?</strong>
                            Professional references are checked by HR once a candidate has been identified for a
                            position. We may also validate your educational history and licenses/certifications.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">Where can I find information on
                                Benefits?</strong> Our Careers site has <a
                                href="/about-asme/who-we-are/careers-at-asme/our-benefits">benefit information</a> along
                            with other things that make employees excited to work at ASME.</p>

                        <p><strong data-style-removed="color:#a5ad07;">Is travelling a requirement for the job?</strong>
                            Some positions within ASME do require travel but not all. If travelling is required for the
                            position we will be sure to post that information within the job posting.</p>
