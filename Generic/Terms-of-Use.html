<h3>6. Posting User Content </h3>
<p>Our Site contains social networking features, discussion forums and other features that allow users
  (&ldquo;<strong>Users</strong>&rdquo;) to submit and share text, commentary, messages, information, documents,
  images, questions, links, and other material (all together, &ldquo;<strong>User Content</strong>&rdquo;).</p>
<p>User Content should relate to ASME&rsquo;s purposes, which are described in our Articles of Incorporation and
  Constitution as follows:</p>
<ul class="primary-list">
  <li>promoting the art, science and practice of mechanical engineering and the allied arts and sciences;</li>
  <li>encouraging original research;</li>
  <li>fostering engineering education;</li>
  <li>advancing engineering standards;</li>
  <li>promoting information exchanges among engineers and others;</li>
  <li>broadening the usefulness of the engineering profession in cooperation with other engineering and
    technical
    societies, and promoting a high level of ethical practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Users volunteer their experience and information to other Users as facilitators
  (&ldquo;<strong>Facilitators</strong>&rdquo;). For example, Facilitators may assist by contributing material
  or
  answering questions for other Users. Facilitators may identify themselves as being affiliated with ASME (e.g.,
  because of a position they hold in an ASME section or group). However, Facilitators are not ASME&rsquo;s
  employees
  or agents for any purposes whatsoever, and Users should not rely on Facilitators as agents or representatives
  of
  ASME. Each User, including each Facilitator, participates on Our Site in that User&rsquo;s individual
  capacity, and
  not as a representative of ASME. If you serve as a Facilitator, you are solely responsible for all of your
  activities in that capacity.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>7. Conduct on Our Site</h3>
<p>When you use Our Site, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>
<ul class="primary-list">
  <li>You will not use Our Site (i) to send chain letters, unsolicited advertising, or any other junk or bulk
    mail, or
    (ii) for the benefit of third-party organizations, businesses, products, or services.</li>
  <li>You will not impersonate or try to pass yourself off as any other person or entity. </li>
  <li>You will not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any information, files, code or
    other
    materials that are unlawful, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or libelous, or that are threatening,
    abusive,
    or harassing on the basis of an individual's (or group's) religion, gender, sexual orientation, race,
    ethnicity,
    age, disability, or any other protected characteristic. </li>
  <li>You will not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any information, files, code or
    other
    materials that contain viruses or are able to disrupt or damage Our Site or ASME software, hardware or other
    equipment.</li>
  <li>You take sole responsibility for your User Content. </li>
  <li>Your User Content is non-confidential and any ideas, inventions, or know-how disclosed in them will be
    available
    to other Users (though Our Site may offer privacy controls with respect to certain User Content, as
    described in
    the <a href="/about-asme/privacy-and-security-statement" title="Security and Privacy Statement">Security and
      Privacy Statement</a>). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div style="text-align:right"><a href="#111">back to top</a></div>

<p><a name="8"></a></p>
<h3>8. Responsibility for User Content</h3>
<p>User Content, including User Content contributed by Facilitators, does not necessarily reflect the views,
  policies
  or opinions of ASME, and ASME does not endorse or adopt any User Content (including any external Web sites
  that may
  be listed in any User Content) through the act of making it available on Our Site. ASME bears no
  responsibility for
  any User Content or any injury or offense it causes (regardless of whether the User Content has been approved,
  edited, rejected, or removed by ASME or a User). ASME has no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, edit, or
  delete User
  Content, but ASME reserves the right to do so if any User Content fails to comply with these Terms of Use or
  is
  otherwise harmful, inaccurate, or objectionable. </p>
<p>You take sole responsibility for all User Content you submit, and all User Content you submit must be your
  own. You
  grant ASME a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to reproduce,
  distribute,
  publicly display and perform, transmit, adapt, and translate any User Content you submit, in whole or in part
  and in
  any medium now known or later developed, for the purpose of making it available on Our Site. You represent and
  warrant that the User Content you submit does not (i) defame any party; (ii) violate any party&rsquo;s
  copyright,
  trademark, patent, trade secret, right to privacy or publicity, or any other proprietary or personal right;
  (iii)
  contain any material or information furnished to you in confidence or with the understanding that it would not
  be
  disclosed or published (including, but not limited to, any confidential information related to the business of
  your
  employer, colleagues, or clients); or (iv) otherwise violate any applicable law or regulation. You
  additionally
  represent, warrant and covenant that you are under no obligation that would in any way interfere with the
  disclosure
  or use of any User Content you submit.</p>
<p>You submit User Content entirely at your own risk. Because ASME cannot guarantee the security or
  confidentiality of
  any User Content, you should consider all User Content you submit to be non-confidential and assume that any
  ideas,
  inventions, or know-how disclosed in it could be made available to the public. ASME is not responsible for any
  third
  party&rsquo;s misuse or misappropriation of any User Content you submit through Our Site. Please refer to our
  <a href="/about-asme/privacy-and-security-statement" title="Security and Privacy Statement">Security and
    Privacy
    Statement</a> for more information regarding ASME&rsquo;s use of User Content.</p>
<p>ASME has no obligation to pre-screen, monitor, edit, or delete User Content, but ASME reserves the right to
  do so,
  including if any User Content do not comply with ASME&rsquo;s purposes or these Terms or are otherwise
  harmful,
  inaccurate or objectionable. ASME is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing User Content that
  fails to
  comply with these Terms. For avoidance of doubt, ASME has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a
  copy of
  any User Content.</p>
<p>Any complaint about copyright infringement relating to User Content may be made by following the procedures
  in
  these Terms under the heading &ldquo;Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.&rdquo;
</p>

<h3>11. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</h3>
<p>If you believe that any material posted on Our Site infringes your copyright, then you may request the
  removal of
  those materials from Our Site in accordance with the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), and the procedures
  described below. A notice of infringing material (&quot;Notice&quot;) must be sent to the agent we have
  designated
  with the Copyright Office:</p>
<p>John Delli Venneri
  American Society of Mechanical Engineers

  2 Park Avenue
  New York, New York 10016</p>
<p>To comply with the Copyright Act, a Notice must be in writing and must include the following:</p>
<ol class="primary-order">
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works
    are
    covered by a single notification, a representative list of the works; </li>
  <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
    activity and
    that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit
    us to
    locate the material; </li>
  <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and,
    if
    available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted; </li>
  <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
    authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; </li>
  <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury, and
    that you
    are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly
    infringed; and
  </li>
  <li>A physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
    right
    that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>
<p>When we receive a Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will remove the identified material
  immediately.
  We will promptly take reasonable steps to inform the user who posted the allegedly infringing material (the
  &ldquo;alleged infringer&rdquo;) of the Notice and subsequent removal. The alleged infringer may then provide
  us
  with a counter notice (&quot;Counter Notice&rdquo;) that the initial infringement notice was erroneous. To
  comply
  with the Copyright Act, the Counter Notice must be in writing and must include the following:</p>
<ol class="primary-order">
  <li>Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the
    material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; </li>
  <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good faith belief that the material
    was
    removed or access to it disabled as a result of error; </li>
  <li>The alleged infringer&rsquo;s name, address, and telephone number; </li>
  <li>A statement of consent to jurisdiction in federal district court and that the alleged infringer consents
    to
    service of process from the complaining party or its agent; and</li>
  <li>A physical or electronic signature of the alleged infringer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon receipt of a Counter Notice that complies with the Copyright Act, we will notify the sender of the
  Notice of
  the Counter Notice and restore the material within 10 to 14 business days, unless the sender of the Notice
  informs
  us that the sender of the Notice has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the allegedly
  infringing
  party from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Our Site.</p>

<p>ASME, the ASME logo and other ASME indicia of source used on Our Site are owned by ASME (&ldquo;<strong>ASME
    Trademarks</strong>&rdquo;). You may not use any ASME Trademark without our prior written consent. You may
  not use
  any ASME Trademark in connection with any products or services that do not belong to us, or in any manner
  likely to
  cause confusion about the source of any product or service, that implies that ASME endorses any third-party
  product
  or service, or that disparages or discredits ASME. You agree not to register any domain names containing any
  ASME
  Trademark.</p>

<p>You may not frame the content of Our Site. You may not use metatags or any other &ldquo;hidden text&rdquo;
  that
  incorporates ASME Trademarks without our prior written consent. ASME invites companies to link to Our Site but
  only
  if the link is made in good faith and is not derogatory in nature. Any link to Our Site or any of the
  individual web
  pages contained in them should open in a new browser window. Links to Our Site should be in the form of
  hypertext
  that says &quot;ASME&quot; or &quot;The American Society of Mechanical Engineers&quot; and does not use any
  ASME
  logo or design. Please let us know if you link to Our Site by contacting us at <a
    href="mailto:webmaster@asme.org" title="webmaster@asme.org">webmaster@asme.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you link to Our Site, you may not place the link on a web site with content that is libelous, defamatory,
  obscene, pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal or otherwise
  objectionable, or place the link in a manner that would imply ASME&rsquo;s sponsorship, endorsements or
  approval of
  another party&rsquo;s site or activities, constitute or encourage a criminal offense, violate the rights of
  any
  party, or otherwise give rise to liability or violate any applicable law or regulation.</p>

<h3>14. Links to Third Parties from Our Site</h3>
<p>ASME does not link to third-party web sites or non-ASME entities as a general rule, except for content
  partners and
  Sponsors. ASME does not generally provide reciprocal linking (i.e., trading links), but there may be
  exceptions in
  the case of links to sites that are informational in nature. These sites may include travel, hotel,
  entertainment
  and historical sites in the areas where ASME business or activities take place.</p>
<p>We do not control other sites or their content, and you should read the privacy policies and terms of use
  that
  govern your use of other sites. The inclusion of links on Our Site, including links to the websites of our
  Sponsors,
  does not imply ASME's endorsement of that site, the organization operating the site, or any products or
  services
  offered by the operator of that site.</p>

<h3>15. Language Translation Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Translations of ASME web sites are done using a third-party service provider (Motionpoint, Inc.). Neither
  ASME nor
  any agency, officer, or employee of ASME warrants the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information
  translated by this system and will not be liable for any losses caused by any reliance on the accuracy,
  reliability,
  or timeliness of the translation. While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the translation,
  portions may
  be incorrect. Any person or entity who relies on information obtained from the system does so at his or her
  own

<h3>16. Email Alias Disclaimer</h3>
<p>ASME offers its Members an email alias. The alias is a simple &quot;store and forward&quot; mechanism that
  accepts
  email sent to the alias name and forwards it to the Member's actual email address. Once an email alias is
  issued to
  a Member, ASME makes no guarantees about the future privacy of the alias. ASME has taken measures to protect
  Members
  from spam in the form of adding third-party spam-blocking services; however, because the software cannot
  guarantee
  complete spam blocking, Members must take sole responsibility for protecting against publication or misuse of
  their
  email aliases. Therefore, Members use the email alias service at their own risk.</p>
