<p><strong data-style-removed="color: #ff0000;">CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS</strong></p>
	<p>Since 1973, ASME has sponsored the Congressional Fellowship program to provide an opportunity for Society members to work with the U.S. Congress. As federal legislation becomes increasingly technical, the need for engineering expertise is essential. Congressional fellows participate directly in the lawmaking process and learn how the federal government operates. In addition, Congress is provided with the necessary engineering expertise and, at the end of the fellowship year, a fellow's employer has an engineer with in-depth knowledge of congressional decision-making processes.</p>
	<p>Once chosen as a congressional fellow, an ASME member selects his or her congressional assignment through interviews with congressional offices, with assistance from the ASME government relations staff, and with reference to ASME’s priority issues, which includes “Advanced Manufacturing.”</p>
	<p> <strong>Applicant Background</strong>

		Applicants for this Fellowship must have a strong manufacturing background. ASME has long supported efforts to promote manufacturing and improved processes such as additive manufacturing. We are aligned with public policies that keep the US manufacturing supply chain strong and build upon innovative methods and processes. We support federal investments in research and development, including the Manufacturing USA Institutes, which are focused on additive manufacturing, robotics, biofabrication, smart sensors and digital process controls, advanced functional fabrics with integrated devices, flexible manufacturing capabilities, and more.  ASME’s General Position Paper entitled &ldquo;Strengthening the U.S. Manufacturing Sector&rdquo; is available to view at <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/Advocacy/Policy-Publications/PS-17-01-Strengthening-The-US-Manufacturing-Sector-General-Position-Paper.pdf

	<p> <strong>Recruitment and Training</strong>

		Fellows may serve from January through December, or September through August, at their option. An ASME selection committee screens applications and will notify selected candidates in February or March of their interest in scheduling an interview. Interviews with final candidates will be convened in April. After the interviews, the selection committee may tentatively match finalists with available fellowship opportunities. Selected fellows will receive offers in late April or early May. ASME Congressional Fellows are required to attend a two-week orientation course in Washington, DC, in September. Paid for by ASME, but administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the course provides useful training and a foundation for a fellow's network that serves as both a formal and informal resource for participants throughout the fellowship year.</p>
	<p><strong>Financial Support of Federal Government Fellows</strong>

		ASME has a limited number of stipends of $80,000 per congressional/federal government fellow. Because the stipend is not intended to be the fellow's entire financial support, the remaining salary and other costs, including benefits, must be negotiated between the fellow and his or her employer. Society members selected for congressional fellowships typically take a one-year leave of absence from their employer.</p>
