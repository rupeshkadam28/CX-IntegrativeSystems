                        <p><strong>CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since 1973, ASME has sponsored the Congressional Fellowship program to provide an opportunity
                            for Society members to work with the U.S. Congress. As federal legislation becomes
                            increasingly technical, the need for engineering expertise is essential. Congressional
                            fellows participate directly in the lawmaking process and learn how the federal government
                            operates. In addition, Congress is provided with the necessary engineering expertise and, at
                            the end of the fellowship year, a fellow's employer has an engineer with in-depth knowledge
                            of congressional decision-making processes.</p>
                        <p>Once chosen as a congressional fellow, an ASME member selects his or her congressional
                            assignment through interviews with congressional offices, with assistance from the ASME
                            government relations staff, and with reference to ASME’s priority issues, which includes
                            “Advanced Manufacturing.”</p>
                        <p> <strong>Applicant Background</strong><br>

                            Applicants for this Fellowship must have a strong manufacturing background. ASME has long
                            supported efforts to promote manufacturing and improved processes such as additive
                            manufacturing. We are aligned with public policies that keep the US manufacturing supply
                            chain strong and build upon innovative methods and processes. We support federal investments
                            in research and development, including the Manufacturing USA Institutes, which are focused
                            on additive manufacturing, robotics, biofabrication, smart sensors and digital process
                            controls, advanced functional fabrics with integrated devices, flexible manufacturing
                            capabilities, and more. ASME’s General Position Paper entitled &ldquo;Strengthening the U.S.
                            Manufacturing Sector&rdquo; is available to view at 
                            <a href="/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/Advocacy/Policy-Publications/PS-17-01-Strengthening-The-US-Manufacturing-Sector-General-Position-Paper.pdf">https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/ResourceFiles/AboutASME/Get%20Involved/Advocacy/Policy-Publications/PS-17-01-Strengthening-The-US-Manufacturing-Sector-General-Position-Paper.pdf</a>

                        <p><strong>Recruitment and Training</strong><br>

                            Fellows may serve from January through December, or September through August, at their
                            option. An ASME selection committee screens applications and will notify selected candidates
                            in February or March of their interest in scheduling an interview. Interviews with final
                            candidates will be convened in April. After the interviews, the selection committee may
                            tentatively match finalists with available fellowship opportunities. Selected fellows will
                            receive offers in late April or early May. ASME Congressional Fellows are required to attend
                            a two-week orientation course in Washington, DC, in September. Paid for by ASME, but
                            administered by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the course
                            provides useful training and a foundation for a fellow's network that serves as both a
                            formal and informal resource for participants throughout the fellowship year.</p>

                        <p><strong>Financial Support of Federal Government Fellows</strong><br>
                            ASME has a limited number of stipends of $80,000 per congressional/federal government
                            fellow. Because the stipend is not intended to be the fellow's entire financial support, the
                            remaining salary and other costs, including benefits, must be negotiated between the fellow
                            and his or her employer. Society members selected for congressional fellowships typically
                            take a one-year leave of absence from their employer.</p>

                            <li>Sex, creed, race, ethnic background, and political affiliation are expressly excluded as
                                selection criteria for fellows.
                                The fellowship does not create an employer-employee relationship with the government nor
                                with ASME.</li>
                            <li>During the entire selection process, applicants shall only contact a prospective
                                government host office with the knowledge and consent of the ASME program manager.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Except for the congressional fellows, final selection of the federal government fellows
                                is conditional upon consent of the host government office where the fellow will be
                                working during the fellowship year and successful completion of any necessary agreements
                                between the host office and ASME.</li>
                            <li>The federal government fellow may receive a stipend of $80,000. The remaining salary,
                                moving expenses, and all other costs (including fringe benefits) must be negotiated
                                between the fellow and his or her current employer (if applicable).</li>
                            <li> ASME's financial liability to the federal government fellow does not exceed the amount
                                of any expenses approved by the ASME program manager. No person or entity shall have any
                                claim against ASME for any other expenses, nor for the actions of the fellows.</li>
                            <li>Federal government fellows shall be willing to make oral presentations and appearances
                                at a reasonable number of ASME functions during their fellowship year. Travel expenses
                                for such activities will be paid by ASME. Any travel must be approved in advance by the

                            <li> Fellows must attend an orientation program in Washington, D.C., preceding the
                                fellowship; his or her employer must be prepared to give the fellow this time off. The
                                orientation program is paid by ASME.</li>
                            <li>Fellows must submit monthly activity reports to the ASME program manager.</li>
                            <li> Fellows must comply with ASME policy on conflict of interest. In addition, White House

                                White House, or other government office by permitting improper influence by any

                                any partisan political activities during the term of appointment, including campaign
                                activities.</li>
                            <li>In the event of malfeasance on the part of a fellow, as determined by the ASME Committee
                                on Government Relations, the fellowship may be suspended immediately.</li>
                            <li>After they have completed their term, fellows will be asked to serve as adjunct members
                                of the ASME Committee on Government Relations and encouraged to participate in the
                                Society's public affairs activities.</li>
