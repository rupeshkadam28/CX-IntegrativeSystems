<h3>General</h3>
<p><strong>What is a standard?</strong></p>
<p>A standard can be defined as a set of technical definitions and guidelines, &#8220;how
    to&#8221; instructions for designers, manufacturers, and users. Standards promote safety,
    reliability, productivity, and efficiency in almost every industry that relies on
    engineering components or equipment. Standards can run from a few paragraphs to hundreds of
    pages, and are written by experts with knowledge and expertise in a particular field who sit
    on many committees.</p>
<p><strong>Are standards mandatory?</strong></p>
<p>Standards are considered voluntary because they serve as guidelines, but do not of themselves
    have the force of law. ASME cannot force any manufacturer, inspector, or installer to follow
    ASME standards. Their use is voluntary.
    Standards become mandatory when they have been incorporated into a business contract or
    incorporated into regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Why are standards effective?</strong></p>
<p>Standards are a vehicle of communication for producers and users. They serve as a common
    language, defining quality and establishing safety criteria. Costs are lower if procedures
    are standardized; training is also simplified.
    Interchangeability is another reason. It is not uncommon for a consumer to buy a nut in
    California for a bolt purchased in New Jersey. </p>
<h3>How Standards Are Developed</h3>
<p><strong>What is the involvement of ASME in codes and standards today? </strong></p>
<p>Since the beginning of industrialization, ASME and many other standards developing
    organizations have worked to fulfill the growing need for standards in today&rsquo;s world.
    Through a voluntary, consensus process, ASME standards are developed to protect the health
    and welfare of the public. In addition to developing these standards ASME provides
    conformity assessment processes which help to ensure the manufacturers are capable of
    complying with the relevant specifications and that certain personnel are properly
    qualified.</p>
<p>ASME publishes its standards; accredits users of standards to ensure that they are capable of
    manufacturing products that meet those standards; and provides stamps that accredited
    manufacturers place on their products, indicating the manufacturer's certification that a
    product was manufactured according to a standard.</p>
<p><strong>Where does a request for a new code or standard come from?</strong></p>
<p>A request for a code or standard may come from individuals, committees, professional
    organizations, government agencies, industry groups, public interest groups, or from an ASME
    division or section. The request is first referred to the appropriate supervisory board for
    consideration. The board then assigns the request to an existing committee of knowledgeable
    volunteers or determines that a new standards committee must be formed. Once an appropriate
    Committee has concluded that there is enough interest and need the standards developing
    process is initiated.</p>
<p><strong>What type of procedures do ASME Standards Committees follow? </strong></p>
<p>Procedures must reflect openness, transparency, balance of interest, and due process.
    Committee meetings addressing technical issues must be open to the public, and procedures
    are used to govern deliberations and voting. Committees must represent a balance of
    interested parties, and all comments on technical documents during the final approval
    process must be considered. Any individual may appeal any action or inaction of a committee
    relating to membership, or a code or standard promulgated by the committee.</p>
<p><strong>What does &quot;Consensus&quot; mean?</strong></p>
<p>Consensus [as defined by American National Standards Institute (ANSI)] means substantial
    agreement has been reached by directly and materially affected interest categories. This
    signifies the concurrence of more than a simple majority, but not necessarily unanimity.
    Consensus requires that all views and objections be considered, and that an effort be made
    toward their resolution</p>
<p><strong>What type of voting procedures do ASME Standards Committees follow?</strong></p>
<p>Voting procedures for the standards committee are designed to ensure consensus as defined by
    ANSI. Voting is conducted at meetings and votes are also sent by mail, email and through the
    ASME web site. Repeated voting may be necessary to resolve negative votes. If an individual
    member feels that due process was not observed, appeals may be made to the standards
    committee, supervisory board, and subsequently, to the Board on Hearings and Appeals.</p>
<p>The proposed standard (or revision) is also subject to a public review in Mechanical
    Engineering magazine, and on the ASME web site, and usually in ANSI's Standards Action
    publication. Anyone may submit comments during the public review period, to which the
    committee must respond. The draft is also submitted for approval to the supervisory board
    and ANSI. When all considerations have been satisfied, the document is approved as an
    American National Standard and published by ASME.</p>
<p><strong>Why are codes and standards revised?</strong></p>
<p>Codes and standards are living documents that are constantly revised to reflect new
    developments and technical advances (e.g., new materials, new designs and new applications).
</p>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<p><strong>How is ASME organized to produce codes and standards? </strong></p>
<p>Within ASME, the Council on Standards and Certification reports to the Board of Governors.
    Under this Council, there are five standards developing supervisory boards that manage over
    70 consensus committees with 4700 volunteer members and four advisory boards. The
    supervisory boards are responsible for pressure technology, nuclear installations, safety
    codes and standards, standardization and performance test codes and conformity assessment.
    The supervisory boards in turn have standards committees, each responsible for an area of
    standards development. The advisory boards deal with strategic initiatives, energy and
    environmental standards, hearings and appeals and council operations.</p>
<p><strong>Is ASME part of the government?</strong></p>
<p>No, ASME is an independent, not-for-profit organization. ASME is one of the oldest and most
    respected standards developing organizations (SDO) in the world. It produces and maintains
    approximately 550codes and standards, covering a multitude of technical areas including
    boiler components, elevators, hand tools, fasteners, and pipelines to name just a few.</p>
<p><strong>Who are the members of Standards Committees?</strong></p>
<p>The standards committees are composed of volunteers from various segments of the particular
    industry. The volunteers are dedicated people from many walks of life. </p>
<p>ASME standards committees are required to maintain a balance of members in various interest
    classifications so that no one group dominates. Some examples of the various interest
    classifications are: users, manufacturers, consultants, insurance interests, universities,
    testing laboratories, and government regulatory agencies. </p>
<p>Volunteers must agree to adhere to the ASME Policy on Conflict of Interest, the
    Engineer&#8217;s Code of Ethics and Standards and Certification's copyright policies. </p>
<p><strong>How can I find information concerning a particular Standards Committee? </strong></p>
<p>We have a searchable database(<a title="Search for C&amp;S Staff"

        here</a>) where you can search by committee designation or by a keyword.</p>


<h3>ANSI</h3>
<p><strong>What is ANSI? </strong></p>
<p>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a privately funded federation of business
    and industry, standards developers, trade associations, labor unions, professional
    societies, consumers, academia, and government agencies. ANSI does not itself write
    standards. ANSI is the United States member of International Organization for
    Standardization.</p>
<p><strong>Is ASME Accredited by ANSI? </strong></p>
<p>ASME is an accredited Standards Developing Organization that meets the due process
    requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Standards that are
    developed under an accredited program may be designated as American National Standards.</p>


<h3>ISO International Organization for Standardization</h3>
<p><strong>What is ISO?</strong> </p>
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
<p><strong>Is ASME involved in ISO Committees? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, currently many ASME committees provide input to ISO Committees through the U.S.
    technical advisory groups (TAGs). All United States participation is implemented by the
    selection/establishment of US TAGS for ISO technical committees or subcommittees. ASME
    administers approximately 40 U.S. TAGS.</p>
