                      <h3>General</h3>
                      <p><strong>What is a standard?</strong></p>
                      <p>A standard can be defined as a set of technical definitions and guidelines, &#8220;how
                          to&#8221; instructions for designers, manufacturers, and users. Standards promote safety,
                          reliability, productivity, and efficiency in almost every industry that relies on
                          engineering components or equipment. Standards can run from a few paragraphs to hundreds of
                          pages, and are written by experts with knowledge and expertise in a particular field who sit
                          on many committees.</p>
                      <p><strong>Are standards mandatory?</strong></p>
                      <p>Standards are considered voluntary because they serve as guidelines, but do not of themselves
                          have the force of law. ASME cannot force any manufacturer, inspector, or installer to follow
                          ASME standards. Their use is voluntary.
                          Standards become mandatory when they have been incorporated into a business contract or
                          incorporated into regulations.</p>
                      <p><strong>Why are standards effective?</strong></p>
                      <p>Standards are a vehicle of communication for producers and users. They serve as a common
                          language, defining quality and establishing safety criteria. Costs are lower if procedures
                          are standardized; training is also simplified.
                          Interchangeability is another reason. It is not uncommon for a consumer to buy a nut in
                          California for a bolt purchased in New Jersey. </p>

                  
                      <h3>How Standards Are Developed</h3>
                      <p><strong>What is the involvement of ASME in codes and standards today? </strong></p>
                      <p>Since the beginning of industrialization, ASME and many other standards developing
                          organizations have worked to fulfill the growing need for standards in today&rsquo;s world.
                          Through a voluntary, consensus process, ASME standards are developed to protect the health
                          and welfare of the public. In addition to developing these standards ASME provides
                          conformity assessment processes which help to ensure the manufacturers are capable of
                          complying with the relevant specifications and that certain personnel are properly
                          qualified.</p>
                      <p>ASME publishes its standards; accredits users of standards to ensure that they are capable of
                          manufacturing products that meet those standards; and provides stamps that accredited
                          manufacturers place on their products, indicating the manufacturer's certification that a
                          product was manufactured according to a standard.</p>
                      <p><strong>Where does a request for a new code or standard come from?</strong></p>
                      <p>A request for a code or standard may come from individuals, committees, professional
                          organizations, government agencies, industry groups, public interest groups, or from an ASME
                          division or section. The request is first referred to the appropriate supervisory board for
                          consideration. The board then assigns the request to an existing committee of knowledgeable
                          volunteers or determines that a new standards committee must be formed. Once an appropriate
                          Committee has concluded that there is enough interest and need the standards developing
                          process is initiated.</p>
                      <p><strong>What type of procedures do ASME Standards Committees follow? </strong></p>
                      <p>Procedures must reflect openness, transparency, balance of interest, and due process.
                          Committee meetings addressing technical issues must be open to the public, and procedures
                          are used to govern deliberations and voting. Committees must represent a balance of
                          interested parties, and all comments on technical documents during the final approval
                          process must be considered. Any individual may appeal any action or inaction of a committee
                          relating to membership, or a code or standard promulgated by the committee.</p>
                      <p><strong>What does &quot;Consensus&quot; mean?</strong></p>
                      <p>Consensus [as defined by American National Standards Institute (ANSI)] means substantial
                          agreement has been reached by directly and materially affected interest categories. This
                          signifies the concurrence of more than a simple majority, but not necessarily unanimity.
                          Consensus requires that all views and objections be considered, and that an effort be made
                          toward their resolution</p>
                      <p><strong>What type of voting procedures do ASME Standards Committees follow?</strong></p>
                      <p>Voting procedures for the standards committee are designed to ensure consensus as defined by
                          ANSI. Voting is conducted at meetings and votes are also sent by mail, email and through the
                          ASME web site. Repeated voting may be necessary to resolve negative votes. If an individual
                          member feels that due process was not observed, appeals may be made to the standards
                          committee, supervisory board, and subsequently, to the Board on Hearings and Appeals.</p>
                      <p>The proposed standard (or revision) is also subject to a public review in Mechanical
                          Engineering magazine, and on the ASME web site, and usually in ANSI's Standards Action
                          publication. Anyone may submit comments during the public review period, to which the
                          committee must respond. The draft is also submitted for approval to the supervisory board
                          and ANSI. When all considerations have been satisfied, the document is approved as an
                          American National Standard and published by ASME.</p>
                      <p><strong>Why are codes and standards revised?</strong></p>
                      <p>Codes and standards are living documents that are constantly revised to reflect new
                          developments and technical advances (e.g., new materials, new designs and new applications).
                      </p>

                      <h3>Organization</h3>
                      <p><strong>How is ASME organized to produce codes and standards? </strong></p>
                      <p>Within ASME, the Council on Standards and Certification reports to the Board of Governors.
                          Under this Council, there are five standards developing supervisory boards that manage over
                          70 consensus committees with 4700 volunteer members and four advisory boards. The
                          supervisory boards are responsible for pressure technology, nuclear installations, safety
                          codes and standards, standardization and performance test codes and conformity assessment.
                          The supervisory boards in turn have standards committees, each responsible for an area of
                          standards development. The advisory boards deal with strategic initiatives, energy and
                          environmental standards, hearings and appeals and council operations.</p>
                      <p><strong>Is ASME part of the government?</strong></p>
                      <p>No, ASME is an independent, not-for-profit organization. ASME is one of the oldest and most
                          respected standards developing organizations (SDO) in the world. It produces and maintains
                          approximately 550codes and standards, covering a multitude of technical areas including
                          boiler components, elevators, hand tools, fasteners, and pipelines to name just a few.</p>
                      <p><strong>Who are the members of Standards Committees?</strong></p>
                      <p>The standards committees are composed of volunteers from various segments of the particular
                          industry. The volunteers are dedicated people from many walks of life. </p>
                      <p>ASME standards committees are required to maintain a balance of members in various interest
                          classifications so that no one group dominates. Some examples of the various interest
                          classifications are: users, manufacturers, consultants, insurance interests, universities,
                          testing laboratories, and government regulatory agencies. </p>
                      <p>Volunteers must agree to adhere to the ASME Policy on Conflict of Interest, the
                          Engineer&#8217;s Code of Ethics and Standards and Certification's copyright policies. </p>
                      <p><strong>How can I find information concerning a particular Standards Committee? </strong></p>
                      <p>We have a searchable database(<a title="Search for C&amp;S Staff"

                      <h3>ANSI</h3>
                      <p><strong>What is ANSI? </strong></p>
                      <p>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a privately funded federation of business
                          and industry, standards developers, trade associations, labor unions, professional
                          societies, consumers, academia, and government agencies. ANSI does not itself write
                          standards. ANSI is the United States member of International Organization for
                          Standardization.</p>
                      <p><strong>Is ASME Accredited by ANSI? </strong></p>
                      <p>ASME is an accredited Standards Developing Organization that meets the due process
                          requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Standards that are
                          developed under an accredited program may be designated as American National Standards.</p>

               
                      <h3>ISO International Organization for Standardization</h3>
                      <p><strong>What is ISO?</strong> </p>
                      <p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>
                      <p><strong>Is ASME involved in ISO Committees? </strong></p>
                      <p>Yes, currently many ASME committees provide input to ISO Committees through the U.S.
                          technical advisory groups (TAGs). All United States participation is implemented by the
                          selection/establishment of US TAGS for ISO technical committees or subcommittees. ASME
                          administers approximately 40 U.S. TAGS.</p>
