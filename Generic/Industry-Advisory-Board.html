                            ASME established the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) in 1987 to help ensure that ASME programs
                            are relevant and effective for its members in industry and to strengthen the Society&rsquo;s
                            ties with industry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The majority of ASME&rsquo;s non-student members are employed by industry, representing a
                            wide range of companies, all of which have strong technical components.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The IAB is sustained by the solicitation of ideas and recommendations from its members to
                            benefit <span>industry, ASME, and the profession</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Membership</h2>


                        <p>
                            The IAB is comprised of industry executives in the C-suites of large, medium, and small
                            companies that employ ASME members. These companies represent the technological
                            diversity
                            aligned with ASME&rsquo;s five core technology areas: Manufacturing, Pressure
                            Technology,
                            Clean Energy, Bioengineering, and Robotics.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Membership in the IAB requires the representative of the company to attend meetings
                            in-person twice a year. During these meetings, ASME provides industry executives an
                            opportunity to share their engineering insights into areas beyond their specific
                            industry.
                            This allows them to learn how other companies are developing their engineering processes
                            to
                            keep up with new technological developments and to strengthen their own networks.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            IAB Member companies also provide their varied perspectives to ASME so ASME can better
                            formulate and execute its vision in support of the profession and improve its global
                            reach
                            in shaping the next generation of engineers.

                        <p>
