                          From the copy to the right, several lessons can be observed regarding the time and skills
                          called upon during the nomination and ceremony-planning process.

                          The Kinne Collection was first nominated in 1992 and was deferred pending the renovation of
                          the display. The championing of the nomination changed over the years. The Section committee
                          consisted of a half dozen members, each fulfilling multiple roles, as well as experts and
                          curators from the community and the historical society.</p>
                      <p>Once the ceremony planning began, coordination of many groups was necessary to ensure full
                          participation and to provide the necessary recognition for those who had done so much to see
                          the collection preserved and to help the Section complete its tasks.</p>
                      <p>The ceremony was held 19 June 1999, and the celebration was a reward for the teamwork and
                          enthusiasm that had carried it forward all those years. To see how special the event was,

                      <p>The initial effort to designate the Clarence E. Kinne Water Turbine Collection an ASME
                          Mechanical Engineering Heritage Collection came from Euan F. C. Somerscales, former chair of
                          the ASME History and Heritage Committee. Dr. Somerscales prepared the original draft of the
                          collection's nomination with the assistance of Jane Mork Gibson of Philadelphia,
                          Pennsylvania. Ms. Gibson has an unrivaled knowledge of Clarence E. Kinne and his water
                          turbine collection, having presented a paper entitled "Water Power in the North Country:
                          Clarence E. Kinne and His Turbine Collection" at the 21st Annual Conference of the Society
                          for Industrial Archeology in Buffalo, New York, on June 6, 1992.</p>
                      <p>Dr. Persijs Kolberg, former director of the Jefferson County Historical Society, graciously
                          permitted Dr. Somerscales to examine in detail and photograph the Kinne Collection.</p>
                      <p>Edward K. Parker, Clarence Kinne's grandson, provided invaluable information about his
                          grandfather and the collection. T. Urling Walker, a Historical Society trustee and member of
                          the Syracuse Section of ASME, kept the nomination moving forward. Fred H. Rollins, director
                          of the Jefferson County Historical Society, and Elise Davis Chan, curator of collections of
                          the Historical Society, lent their support and the museum's resources to the preparation of
                          the revised submittal of the nomination and of this brochure.</p>
                      <p>Several members of the Syracuse Section of ASME provided time and effort to the designation.
                          History and Heritage chair William A. Kehoe revised and submitted the nomination, with
                          assistance from Bruce Marcham, the Section chair. W. Robert Zeigler, Northern Coordinator
                          for the Section photographed the exhibits in the collection and helped to coordinate, fund,
                          and expedite the designation process. Fredric Wenthen, P.E., compiled the text in this
                          brochure with the help of Bruce Marcham, Francis J. Kelly, Ernest Wass, and W. Robert
                          Zeigler. Design of this brochure was donated by Catherine Wenthen.</p>
