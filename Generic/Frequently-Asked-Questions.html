          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
          <p>ASME's product certification programs have grown dramatically. Starting with just two countries in the
            years prior to 1972, there are now 74 countries in which companies have been certified. ASME is proud that
            the value of these certification programs has been so widely acknowledged, and that ASME is playing this
            increasingly vital role in fostering product safety and international commerce.</p>
          <p>The growth of these programs has presented many new opportunities, but also some challenges, especially
            regarding how to maintain the trademark registrations of ASME's 28 separate Certification Marks across the
            more than 100 nations in which these marks are currently used on products.</p>
          <p>In order to streamline our multiple marking processes and more effectively manage our numerous global
            relationships, ASME is pleased to announce the introduction of a new single Certification Mark.</p>
          <p>Instead of 28 separate Certification Marks, there will now be this single comprehensive mark. To maintain a
            link to the current marks, the new mark will be used in conjunction with a &quot;Certification
            Designator&quot; to indicate the applicability of the certification. The image shows an example of how the
            new mark would be used on a nameplate (in this case for a vessel constructed to Section VIII, Division 2).
