                        <p><strong>Join an ASME Standards &amp; Certification Committee</strong></p>
                        <p>Enduring relationships with stakeholders in a broad range of industries have played a key
                            role in ASME's success. Among our most valuable assets are volunteers who serve on our
                            standards development committees.</p>
                        <p>Many ASME standards development committees include a range of smaller (subtier) units â€“
                            subcommittees, subgroups, working groups and project teams that develop, update and maintain
                            ASME's extensive portfolio of standards.</p>
                        <p><strong>Membership Criteria</strong></p>
                        <p>Committee participation is free, open to anyone with an interest in the subject area and the
                            requisite technical expertise. Membership in ASME is encouraged but not required. Note that
                            committee members are always viewed as individuals, not as representatives of their
                            employers or other organizations.</p>
                        <p>Criteria for membership appointments include:</p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li>Your experience and technical qualifications</li>
                            <li>Your ability to participate in committee activities</li>
                            <li>The business interest of the organization, if any, that supports your committee
                                participation (interest classification)</li>
                            <li>Committee size limits </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>At the committee's discretion, you may be asked to attend one or more meetings before being
                            considered for membership.</p>
                        <p><strong>Types of Membership </strong></p>
                        <p>ASME has developed a number of mechanisms in order to maximize the ability of interested
                            parties to participate in its standards development activities.</p>
                        <ul class="primary-list">
                            <li>The <strong>member</strong> is the traditional means of participating. The member is
                                required to actively participate in committee discussions, work assignments, vote on
                                ballots, and attend meetings.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>contributing member</strong> is a classification for individuals interested
                                in contributing to standards development activities, but unable to actively/constantly
                                participate. The contributing member is required to participate in committee discussions
                                and work assignments, but attendance at meetings is optional and is only able to review
                                and comment on ballots.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>delegate program</strong> is designed for all parties with a technical
                                interest in specific ASME standards, located outside the U.S. and Canada. Each group
                                applying must be open to membership by qualified experts. The group selects a single
                                individual (delegate) to represent its interests and provide collective group comments
                                on committee standards actions. Delegates must have fluency in the English language and
                                a working knowledge of the technical aspects of the committees work. Delegates, with the
                                support of their group, are expected to comment on proposed revisions, vote on first
                                consideration ballots, and participate on work assignments and committee discussions.
                            </li>
                            <li>The <strong>international working group</strong> (IWG) is designed when a diverse group
                                of individuals in a country or region outside the U.S. and Canada express a desire to
                                contribute to the work of a standards development committee. IWG's are created and their
                                members are appointed by the relevant standards development committee just like any
                                other subtier group. IWG's function like any other subtier group that reports to a main
                                standards development committee, but meet regularly in their own country.</li>
